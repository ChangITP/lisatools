Before getting started running this evaluation package be sure to
download all the galaxy key files and LISA Simulator xml files. For
Challenge 2.2 you will also need to subtract the MBHs.

Begin by compiling all the codes with

./Compile

Next you can either run the Initialization script, or go straight
to the Challenge 2.1 evaluation using the Evaluation script. The
Initialization script uses the full galaxy key file to produce a
comprehensive list of bright sources (SNR > 2 wrt to a good estimate
of the instrument + confusion noise). It then takes this list of
bright sources and runs a BIC analysis to produce a list of
"resolvable" sources. To run on Challenge 2.1 you might type

sh Initialize.csh challenge2.1-strain.xml challenge2.1-key-0.txt Bright2.1.dat Key2.1

The file Bright2.1.dat is then used in the evaluation of entries. The codes in
Initialize.csh produce a bunch of files. The most useful is probably Key2.1_Sn.dat.
It has five columns. The first is frequency, the second is the reference Sn(f),
the third is the residual in the A channel, S_A(f), the fourth is the residual in the
E channel, S_E(f), and the fifth column is the cross spectrum of the resdiual,
S_AE(f). To save time, the brights file produced by the Initialize.csh script,
Bright2.1.dat, has been included in this distribution, so you can skip the (very slow)
initialization step and proceed with the evaluation.

The evaluation script runs several codes and dumps out a huge amount of data into
various files. To run on the PrixWhelanAEI entry for Challenge 2.1, for example, type

sh Evaluation.csh challenge2.1-strain.xml Brights2.1.dat PrixWhelanAEI-challenge2.1-gb-all.txt PrixWhelanAEI2.1

The files

PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report_1.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report_2.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report_3.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report_4.dat

Are report cards produced by the MLDC2_pairing code. This code compare recovered sources to the brights file using
noise weighted residual to do the pairing and full templates to compute the correlations. The _1, _2 etc reports
are for the focus windows. PrixWhelanAEI2.1_report.dat is for all the sources. The columns are:

| # rec | # inj | nwr | correlation | SNR rec | SNR inj | d_f * T | d_theta | d_phi | d_A/A | d_iota | d_psi | d_phase |

Here # rec is the name of the recovered source and # inj is the line in Bright2.1.dat file where the closest match
was found. The quantity "nwr" is noise weighted residual. The other columns should be pretty self explanatory.

The files

PrixWhelan2.1_correlation_histograms.dat 
PrixWhelan2.1_parameter_histograms.dat

contain histogram data (or sometimes binned counts) of the correlations and the parameter errors.

The files

PrixWhelanAEI2.1_metric_report.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_metric_report_1.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_metric_report_2.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_metric_report_3.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_metric_report_4.dat

are produced by the doppler metric pairing code. The columns are:
 
| # rec | # inj | M-distance | correlation | SNR rec | SNR inj | d_f * T | d_theta | d_phi | d_A/A | d_iota | d_psi | d_phase |

here M-distance is the doppler metric distance between the injected and recovered source. The correlation is computed
using the metric, but the correlation summary stats at the end of the file refer to the full correlation computed using
the templates.

The metric correlation histograms and binned counts are in

PrixWhelanAEI_metric_correlation.dat

The remaining files are mostly produced by the BIC analysis. The most interesting are

PrixWhelanAEI_Sn.dat

which gives the residuals (see above for the description of Key2.1_Sn.dat), and the lists
of keepers and rejects.The files

PrixWhelanAEI2.1_rejects.dat
PrixWhelanAEI2.1_keepers.dat

are for the full entry, while PrixWhelanAEI2.1_rejects_W1.dat etc are for the various
focus windows.

There are several other files produced that are not described in this README, and many
mysterious messages that will get printed to the screen as the codes are run. If you want
to know what all the files and messages mean there is always the source code.....
