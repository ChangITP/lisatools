This directory contains two tools:

1. Octave script to match up returned white-dwarf binary signals with
sources in the key.

2. Matplotlib (python) scripts to plot parameter errors.

== Documentation of compareMLDC2Results2Key.m : ==

Usage:

compareResults2Key_pipeline2.m <res-file> <key-file> [ <coincMismatch> ]

Sample usage:

./compareMLDC2Results2Key.m \
   ./PrixWhelanAEI-challenge2.1-gb-all.txt \
   ./KEY_NEW_Final_Challenge-2.1_LISAsim_Targeted_Challenge_all.dat

This script compares an MLDC results file with a key file, pairing off
candidate signals with injected sources.

The results file is in standard MLDC format, with columns:
##  i, candList{i}.Freq,  candList{i}.Delta, candList{i}.Alpha, Amplitude, Polarization, Inclination, InitialPhase

The key file is in our internal format, with columns:
%%         Freq            Lat            Long                2F                A1              A2              A3              A4           Ad         Bd         Cd   Sinv_Tsft

A1, A2, A3, and A4 are the four components of the amplitude vector
A_mu, and are constructed from the four amplitude parameters.  Ad, Bd,
Cd and Sinv_Tsft are quantities used to construct the LWL "metric" on
the amplitude parameter space, and 2F is the length of the A_mu vector
in this metric.

We've provided a key, constructed from the "bright sources" file
challenge2.1-key-0.txt and called it

KEY_NEW_Final_Challenge-2.1_LISAsim_Targeted_Challenge_all.dat

(the LISAsim_Targeted in the name is because we did a targeted search
using the LISA simulator data to get the metric for each set of
doppler parameters).
