To start with go to the directory MLDCevaluation.
You need to place xml files generated by submission page:
http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~mldc/submit-3.html
in the directory Source/Challenge3.. (3.2, 3.2, 3.4) 
If directory Challenge3.2/3.3/3.4 does not exist create it.

If you use Firefox then you can seave xml file generated by submission page
using "File/Save Page As ".  By default, the file format is "Web Page, complete" even 
though the extension remains as xml. This saves the formatted data in the xml file and 
keeps the contents in a separate folder.  Instead you should select "Web page, XML only". 

If the key file is known, you need to place the key file in 
the directory Key.

Put the challenge data file in the directory Data/ and 
un-tar it:
tar -zxvf challenge.....

the evaluations scripts are in the directory bin.

The main script is evaluate-challenge3.py
run 
./bin/evaluate-challenge3.py --help
to see options.
To evaluate submissions with known key file use -k option with name of the key file
The key file for 3.2 has to be modified: the Galaxyy should be removed from there!!!



Start running evaluation from the directory MLDCevaluation:

./bin/evaluate-challenge3.py Challenge3.2

This will commpute first signals in SSB (directory Barycentric),
then converts to TDI (directory TDI). By default booth synthetic LISA
and LISA simulator data will be produced (only synthetic LISA for 3.4).

The results of evaluation will be seen on the screen and also recorded
in the directory Results.

As default the script looks for data and submitted xml files in the directories 
described above, however one can provide the path to the key file, source 
xml file and to data xml file. Please use 
./bin/evaluate-challenge3.py --help
