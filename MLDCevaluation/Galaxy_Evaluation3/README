The evalution script has been simplified relative to the Challenge 3 version. All it does
is sort the bright source file and the entry file by frequency, then compares the injected
and recovered signals. To run the evaluation on the Prix-Whelan entry, for example, just type

./Evaluation.csh challenge3.1-key-0.txt PrixWhelan.txt PrixWhelan

Here challenge3.1-key-0.txt is the bright source file, and PrixWhelan.txt is the entry file. Both MUST
be in the format 

frequency  frequency-derivative  ecliptic-lat ecliptic-long  amplitude  inlination polarization initial-phase

(Note that the Prix-Whelan entry as submitted has an extra, extraneous column, and has to be converted to
the correct format before running the evaluation script.)

Once the script has been run, several files will have been produced, all tagged with the PrixWhelan name.

The file PrixWhelan_report.dat is a report card produced by the MLDC3_pairing code. This code compare recovered sources to the brights file using
noise weighted residual to do the pairing and full templates to compute the correlations.  The columns are:

| # rec | # inj | nwr | correlation | SNR rec | SNR inj | d_f * T | d_fdot * T*T | d_theta | d_phi | d_A/A | d_iota | d_psi | d_phase |

Here # rec is the name of the recovered source and # inj is the line in bright file where the closest match
was found (based of their ordering by frequency). The quantity "nwr" is noise weighted residual. The other columns
are the SNRs or the template and the source, and the parameter errors.

The files

PrixWhelan_correlation_histograms.dat 
PrixWhelan_parameter_histograms.dat

contain histogram data (or sometimes binned counts) of the correlations, the recovered SNR and the parameter errors.
