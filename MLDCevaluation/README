 Evaluation of SMBH and EMRI results from the challenge 1/1B


(I) Preliminary preparations:

(1) you need to download key files and result xml files.
(2) place result xml files in the appropriate directory:
 Source/Challenge1B.2.1/   Source/Challenge1B.2.2/   Source/Challenge1B.3/  
(3) place key files in the directory
Key/ or in Key/Challenge1B
(4) make sure that directories 
Barycentric/ TDI/
contain subdirectories:
 Challenge1.2.1  Challenge1.3     Challenge1B.2.2  
 Challenge1.2.2  Challenge1B.2.1  Challenge1B.3 


(II)
1. Use the script evaluate-challenge1.py 

use it with --help to get all possible options.

(2) if you want to maximize over the phase signal in BBH challenge,
you need to run 

bin/create_quadratures  Key/Challenge1B/challenge1B.2.1-key.xml

and place the resulting file challenge1B.2.1-key_0.xml 
in the directory Key/Challenge1B/

(3) run the script 

evaluate-challenge1.py [options] CHALLENGENAME 


As script runs you'll see output on the screen of the stage at which you are.
At the end you'll get on screen chi^2, SNR, overlaps for each source in the 
challenge.


To get errors in the parameters for EMRI challenge yuo'll need 
to run script 

bin/estimateEMRIerrors.py

use ./bin/estimateEMRIerrors.py --help for help and range of options

The result will be outputed on the screen, order is the same as in the xml file.
