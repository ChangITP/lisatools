  The basic installation is described in INSTALL file.
However you need to link gsl library (compulsory)
and any other library you want to use:

LDFLAGS="-L/directory/lib/"
CPPFLAGS="-I/directory/include/"

To install I run:

./00boot 
(some vesions of automake/autoconfig might require you to run 
.00boot twice, I'd suggest to run it twice for safety)

./configure --prefix=/username/LISAWP/ LDFLAGS="-L/path_to_gsl_lib/lib/" CPPFLAGS="-I/path_to_gsl_includes/include/"

make

make check

"make check" will create executables in subdirectory "examples/" abd execute them

All codes are documented using doxygen, please run doxygen to create documentation.
