This code bundle provides a very fast template
matching code for galactic binaries that can be
used on the MLDC data files.

The templates describe circular, monochromatic binaries
using the low frequency approximation to the LISA instrument
response. I would not recommend using the code for sources
with frequencies greater than 4 mHz. The code generates
the templates for the independent A and E channels directly
in the frequency domain.

To compile the code using the gcc compiler type 

./compile_script

To test the code, go to the MLDC website and download the
LISA Simulator "download" files for Challenge 1.1.1.b
Unpacking the tar file will produce the directory
Training-1.1.1b_LISAsim. Move the .xml and .bin files
from this directory and place them in the same directory as
the executable "MLDC_galactic"

Run the code by typing

./MLDC_galactic Training-1.1.1b.xml 0.0029 0.00292

The first argument tells the code which data set you want
to search. The second two arguments fix the lower and upper
limits on the frequency range that you want your search to
cover.

The code loads in the data and computes a template using
the actual source parameters. It outputs the SNR and the
change in the log likelihood associated with using this
template.

To show how the code might be used in practice, it then
performs a grid search in the neighborhood of the actual
source parameters. The best fit will be different from the
actual parameters due to the instrument noise.

You will probably want to do something smarter than a
7 parameter grid search....
