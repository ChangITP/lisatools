This code bundle generates noise free galaxy data sets for
Challenge 2 of the MLDC series.

After unpacking, the first thing you should do is copy one of the
Fast_Response_XXX executables over to Fast_Response. Currently there
are only executables for 32 Bit Linux (Compiled on a RedHat system with
XEON N series 32 bit processors) and Mac OSX on a G4 and a G5. More
chipsets will be added as they become available.

Next, type 

./Compile

Hopefully this will compile all the open source codes. After
compilation you can test the package by typing

./Galaxy_Test.csh 1 Test

This will read in the Galaxy data file /Data/Galaxy_1.dat, which
contains the three sources from Training_1.1.1 of Challenge 1, and
produce noise free responses for the LISA Simulator and Synthetic
LISA. The data sets are for ~2 years (2^22 points at 15 second cadence).

After about 5 minutes the package should have produced the files

XML/Test_LISAsim_noisefree.xml 
XML/Test_synthLISA_noisefree.xml
XML/Test_key.xml

Binary/Test_LISAsim_noisefree.bin
Binary/Test_synthLISA_noisefree.bin

You can produce the fourier spectrum by typing

./DataImport XML/Test_LISAsim_noisefree.xml 1.0e-5 2.0e-2

which creates the files

Data/X_FFT.dat
Data/Y_FFT.dat
Data/Z_FFT.dat
Data/A_FFT.dat
Data/E_FFT.dat

(The fuzz down at log10(hf) = -35 is numerical noise in the FFT).

If all of this works you can now go ahead and make a full galaxy.
First you will need to visit http://www.physics.montana.edu/faculty/cornish/LISA
and download the base Nelemans galaxy (388M). Gunzip this file and put
it in the /Data sub-directory.

Then type

./Galaxy.csh 12345 Training_2.1

and come back in about an hour. You should find a collection of new xml and
bin files in the XML and Binary subdirectories. For the example given above
you will find

XML/Training_2.1_LISAsim_noisefree.xml 
XML/Training_2.1_synthLISA_noisefree.xml
XML/Training_2.1_key.xml
Binary/Training_2.1_LISAsim_noisefree.bin
Binary/Training_2.1_synthLISA_noisefree.bin
Data/Galaxy_12345.dat
Data/Galaxy_Bright_12345.dat


The key file points to two data files, Galaxy_12345.dat (1G) and
Galaxy_Bright_12345.dat (3M). The first is a complete list of all the sources
that were simulated. The second is a list of about 40,000 bright sources.
The bright sources are sorted in frequency, but the full list is not.
The first 20 entries in the full list are the verification binaries.
(the call ./Galaxy_Maker Training_2.1 1 in the Galaxy.csh flags that
the verification binaries in Data/Verification.dat should be included)

For the MLDC postings we will probably post the bright file and make the
full files available on CD or DVD. Note: The key file will not display
properly using the old version of the LISA xsl file. Michele is working
on a new version that supports the TABLE format. When the new xsl file
is available the key file should be readable.
