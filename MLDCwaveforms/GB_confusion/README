This directory contains codes for simulating a full galaxy and figuring
out the number of bright sources and the confusion levels for 4 (X) and 
5/6 (AE) link operation using arbitrary spacecraft orbits. The code uses  
lapack and blas, so you will likely have to edit the compile script 
(compile) to point to the needed libraries.

The user must supply a list of galactic binaries with columns:

initial frequency | initial df/dt | ecliptic latitude | ecliptic longitude | amplitude | inclination angle | polarization angle | initial phase

which we'll abbreviae as

f0 | dfdt_0 | theta | phi | A | iota | psi | phi_0

This is identical to the MDLC file format with frequencies in Hz, and 
angles in radians.

The user also must include a file containing the {t,x,y,z} components of 
each spacecraft in ecliptic coordinates during the observation time, 
with columns:

t (s) | SC1_x | SC1_y | SC1_z | SC2_x | SC2_y | SC2_z | SC3_x | SC3_y | SC3_z

here all positions are in meters.

For reference, we have used the MLDC4 training data which can be 
downloaded at

http://pandora.aei.mpg.de/~steffeng/MLDC4/FullDataset1/svn1159/challenge4.0-training-key-frequency-1.txt

We have included in this directory a file (EccentricInclined.txt) with the 
baseline orbits used in the MLDCs at a sampling rate of 1/day for a four 
year observation time, as well as a Detector header file (Baseline.h)
corresponding to the orbits of EccentricInclined.txt and a 4 year LISA 
mission with original LISA design shot and acceleration noise.

Before running, create a new .h file to set the following global parameters:

- T     (Observation time [s])
- NFFT  (Number of samples -- should be a power of 2)
- Sps   (Photon shot noise power)
- Sacc  (Acceleration noise power)
 
See Baseline.h for example.

The code determines the average armlength L and the transfer frequency fstar based 
from the orbit file (assuming it is evenly sampled in time).

The spacecraft positions for calculating the detector response are interpolated 
from the supplied orbit file, so be careful that T does not exceed the duration of 
the supplied orbits.  We would recommend naming the header file something memorable 
as all output will be appended with its name.  For example, suppose we run with 
Baseline.h, the EccentricInclined.txt, and the MLDC galaxy:

> ./run Baseline challenge4.0-training-key-frequency-1.txt EccentricInclined.txt

Notice the lack of a file extension on Baseline!

The script then:
- Generates the instrument response to the galaxy
- Makes a preliminary estimate of the confusion noise
- Iteratively removes "bright" GBs and re-estimates the confusion noise
- When finished, the  code computes the Fisher matrix derived uncertainities 
  for all model parameters, including the 2nd time derivative of f (needed 
  to measure luminosity distance) and determines wether fdot and fddot are 
  measurable. 
  
Output files include:  
- 1-sided Confusion noise estimates (X && AE)
  Columns: f (Hz) | X S_n(f) | XS_confusion(f) | AE S_n(f) | AE S_confusion(f)
  (e.g., Confusion_Baseline.dat)
  
- The parameter uncertainities (X || AE) [std. dev. (s_) estimated by the Fisher, fractional uncertainty in df/dt, d^2f/dt^2
  Columns: f0 | df/dt_0 | d^2f/dt^2_0 | theta | phi | A | iota | psi | phi_0 | s_{f} | s_{df/dt} | ...
           ...s_{d^2f/dt&2} | s_{theta} | s_{phi} | s_A | s_{iota} | s_{psi} | s_{phi_0} | signal-to-noise ratio
  (e.g., SigmasX_Baseline.dat and SigmasAE_Baseline.dat)
  
- List of "bright" GBs (X || AE)
  Columns: f0 | dfdt_0 | theta | phi | A | iota | psi | phi_0
  (e.g., BrightX_Baseline.dat and BrightAE_Baseline.dat)
  
- Fourier domain (strain) instrument response to the galaxy (X && AE)
  Columns: f (Hz) | Re{X} | Im{X} | Re{A} | Im{A} | Re{E} | Im{E}
  (e.g., Galaxy_XAE_Baseline.dat)
