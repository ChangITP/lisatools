The Fast_Galaxy code bundle is a stand alone package for generating
noise free responses to a galactic population of white dwarf binaries.
The code generates both phase (LISA Simulator style) and frequency
(Synthetic LISA style) responses. These noise free responses have to
be combined with suitable noise files using the lisatools xml merge routines.

Generating a complete, galaxy only, Challenge or Training data set
is very easy. The package unpacks into its own directory. The next
step is to go to http://www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans/Neil/ and download
the files AMCVn_GWR_MLDC.dat.bz2 and dwd_GWR_MLDC.dat.bz2. Unpack
these files using bunzip2 and put them in the Data sub-directory.
These a big files!

(We will soon have verification binaries for challenge 3, but
these are not included at this stage).

The code is currently hard-wired to produce a 2-year data set at
15 second cadence. These settings can be changed by editing
Constants.h.

To compile all the codes type

./Compile

then run

./Galaxy3.csh 12345 Training_3.1

(The number 12345 is a random number seed - chose whatever you want).
The code will take several hours to run. Once it is done you should find a
collection of xml and bin files in the XML subdirectory. For the example
given above you would find

XML

Training_3.1_LISAsim_noisefree.xml 
Training_3.1_synthLISA_noisefree.xml
Training_3.1_key.xml
Training_3.1_LISAsim_noisefree.bin
Training_3.1_synthLISA_noisefree.bin

Data 

Galaxy_12345.dat
Galaxy_Bright_12345.dat

The names should be pretty self explanatory. You have the noise free X,Y,Z signals
for both LISA Simulator and Synthetic LISA, and the full list of sources, and
a list of the brighter sources (not all of which will be resolvable).
