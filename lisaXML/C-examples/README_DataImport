The DataImport code demonstrates how to read an XML Challenge
data set into a data analysis routine. The code takes the data
set name as a command line argument:

./DataImport Challenge1.1.xml

It then allocates arrays and imports the binary data. The X, Y
and Z channels are then used to form up variants of the A and E
channels. All the data channels are then FFTed and the one sided
strain spectral densities are saved to disk as X_FFT.dat etc.

You can cut and paste the first section of DataImport into
your data analysis programs as an easy way to read in the
challenge data files.

The code is compiled with the command

gcc -O2 -o DataImport DataImport.c ../io-C/lisaxml.c ../io-C/ezxml.c 
           ../io-C/xmlbinary.c ../io-C/readxml.c -lm

The io-C directory contains the xml read-write routines. You will need
to download this directory from sourceforge.
