(require a compiled and installed synthlisa, with the path set)

compare-simulators.py   takes as arguments an XML challenge file produced with
                        synthLISA and an XML challenge file produced with the
                        LISA simulator; converts the synthLISA fractional-frequency
                        X data to phase, and the LISA simulator equivalent strain
                        X data to phase, and outputs the two spectra together with
                        a theoretical curve for X noise. The results are stored
                        in file tdispectrum.xml
                        
plotxml.py              plot spectra from a lisaXML file
