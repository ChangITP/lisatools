\section*{Challenge 3.1: Galactic Binaries}
\subsection*{3.1.1}

Isolated chirping Galactic binaries with circular orbits. Orbital frequency may be increasing or decreasing depending on whether gravitational radiation or mass transfer is the dominant mechanism. Chirp will be modeled up to $\dot{f}$. Data streams will be two years long with Gaussian instrument noise. Each data stream will contain a single chirping binary within 30 $\mu$Hz of \\
\\
a) 5 mHz \\
b) 10 mHz \\
c) 15 mHz.

\subsection*{3.1.2}

A two-year data stream with symmetric instrument noise and the signals from $\sim$ 30 million Galactic binaries. Frequency evolution will follow the model of 3.1.1. Binaries will be drawn from a randomized Nelemans population. Instrument noise will be Gaussian and stationary. There will be around 5 verification binaries drawn from the list of Nelemans.

\section*{Challenge 3.2: Massive Black Holes}

A two-year data stream containing symmetric instrument noise, Galactic binary confusion-noise, and the signal from 4 to 6 spinning black hole binaries. The orbits will be circular so the signal is described by 15 parameters. Modeling will be done to 2PN order. If the merger occurs during the observation time, the signal will include inspiral only --- merger and ringdown will not be included. If the merger occurs after the observation period, it will occur within 120 days after the observation period. The Galactic binary confusion noise will be generated using the non-chirping population from Challenge 2 with the loud signals (as determined from the loud population file generated during the population randomization process) subtracted perfectly from the signal.

\section*{3.3: EMRIs}

A two-year data stream with symmetric instrument noise and 5 EMRIs with the same mass spread as in Challenge 1B.

\section*{3.4: Bursts}

A one-year data stream with non-symmetric, stationary, Gaussian instrument noise and a number of bursts from cosmic cusps. The time distribution will be Poissonian with an event rate of $\sim$ 0.5/week. The SNR will range between 10 and 100. The asymmetry in the noise will be within 20\%.

\section*{3.5: Stochastic Backgrounds}

A one-year data stream with Gaussian and stationary instrument noise plus an isotropic stochastic background of $S_h(f) \propto f^{-3}$, corresponding to an $\Omega =$ constant cosmological background.
