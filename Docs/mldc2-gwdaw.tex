\begin{abstract}
The Mock Data Challenges (MLDC) have the dual purpose of fostering the development of LISA data analysis tools and capabilities, and demonstrating the technical readiness already achieved by the gravitational-wave community in distilling a rich science payoff from the LISA data. The first round of MLDCs has just been completed and the second round data sets have been released. They contain radiation from an entire galactic population of stellar-mass binary systems, massive black hole binaries and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. These data sets provide therefore a realistic test-bed, though still only at the conceptual level, of techniques to tackle the new analysis challenges posed by the mission: global data analysis. Here we describe the second round of MLDC and provide details about its implementation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a spaceborne gravitational-wave (GW) laser-interferometer for the observation of the low-frequency  ($\approx$ 0.1 mHz-- 1 Hz) GW sky, see Danzman's contribution in this volume and~\cite{lisappa}. LISA is an all-sky monitor with the capability of observing a variety of compact-object binary systems, with masses ranging from a fraction to millions of solar masses. Moreover, LISA could discover GWs from entirely new classes of sources, such as exotic compact objects and relics from the early universe, cf.~\cite{ScienceCase,CT2002} and references therein.

The vast majority of LISA sources are visible for months-to-years in the instrument observational window; strong GW foregrounds generated by abundant populations of galactic and extra-galactic white-dwarf binary systems, and possibly by solar-mass compact objects captured by massive black holes in galactic nuclei, will raise above the instrumental noise at frequencies below a few mHz; some signals, such as the extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are instantaneously weak and characterized by complex amplitude and phase evolution controlled by over a dozen parameters. Indeed, there is no established expertise for this kind of data, although much relevant experience has already been gained in the analysis of GW data collected by ground-based detectors. In ground-based observations GWs are rare and weak, whereas in the low-frequency band they are numerous and (a fair fraction of them) yield high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). An important step in preparation for the mission is to tackle these new analysis problems early in order to develop the tools and methods necessary for the maximum science exploitation of such a revolutionary data set.

The LISA International Science Team (LIST) has embarked in a programme to foster the development of data analysis tools and capabilities for LISA, and to evaluate the technical readiness to extract full information from such rich data set. This programme goes under the name of Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC). The MLDC Task Force%
\footnote{Full details regarding the Task Force activities, as well as links to relevant resources, are available on the Task Force wiki~\cite{MLDCwiki}}
% 
has been charged by the LIST to formulate challenge problems, develop standard models of the LISA mission and gravitational wave (GW) sources, provide computing tools (e.g. LISA response simulators, and source waveform generators), establish criteria for the evaluation of the analyses, and provide any technical support necessary to the challenge participants. These challenges are meant to be blind tests, but not really contests; the greatest scientific benefit stemming from them will come from the quantitative comparison of results, analysis methods, and implementations.

The first round of MLDCs~\cite{MLDCLISA06a,MLDCLISA06b} has just been completed. Details on the data sets, techniques developed for the analyses, and results are provided in the companion article in this volume~\cite{MLDC1-summary} and references therein. In this short paper we describe the second round of MLDCs, that has just been released~\cite{MLDCweb}. The second round data sets represent a very significant increase in complexity with respect to those distributed in Challenge-1. More importantly, they contain the full set of key signals that are expected to make up the LISA data set and therefore provide, though still at the conceptual level, a realistic test-bed for different data analysis approaches. The instrument, noise, and waveform models adopted so far in the MLDCs are still simplified; much work is therefore required beyond the completion of Challenge 2 to develop the analysis tools necessary for the missions; future round of MLDCs will address progressively more realistic analysis scenarios and introduce more general gravitational waveforms. The details of the schedule of MLDCs from Challenge 3 onwards are not yet available, but we expect to release the third round of MLDC in Summer 2007.

\section{Mock LISA Data Challenges: Second round}
\label{s:MLDC2}

The first round of MLDCs contained single source data sets, or data sets with several ($\approx 20$) signals well separated in parameter space; an exception were two data sets containing $\approx 50$ signals from galactic binaries all concentrated in a frequency band of width 3 $\mu$Hz. Challenge 1 concentrated also on only two signal classes: monochromatic galactic stellar mass binaries and and massive-black-hole (MBH) binary inspirals. The key goal of this first round of challenges was the development and validation of source specific data analysis techniques for the minimum science requirement signals. Challenge 2 has a much more realistic flavour: it includes millions of sources, as we expect in reality, and we have added to galactic binary systems and massive-black hole binaries also Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRI).  This round of challenges will require to tackle \emph{global analysis} and the most challenging signal that we expect to observe with LISA. 

Challenge 2 includes five single-source data sets (Challenge 1.3.1)%
\footnote{These data set are still identified by 1.X because training data sets were distributed with Challenge 1; blind data sets are however released only now. For consistency with previous documents, we maintain the original nomenclature},
% 
dedicated specifically to EMRIs, and two multi-source data sets (Challenge 2.1 and 2.2). All the data sets are all $\approx 2$ yrs long -- they contain $2^{22}$ data points sampled at a cadence of 15 sec. More in detail the data sets are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Challenge 1.3.1}: five data sets, each of which contains radiation from a single EMRI with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximately in the range 100-30;
\item \emph{Challenge 2.1}: it contains radiation from (i) a whole population of galactic binary systems (about 30 million sources), including (ii) 20 "verification binaries";
\item \emph{Challenge 2.2}: it contains radiation from (i) a whole population of galactic binary systems (about 30 million sources), including (ii) 20 "verification binaries"; (iii) an \emph{unknown} number (between 4 and 6) of MBH binaries with a range of SNRs (between $\approx 2000$ and $\approx 10$) and coalescence time; and (iv) 5 EMRIs, with SNR in the range $\approx 100 - 20$.
\end{itemize}
Details about the range of the source parameters included in the data sets is given in Table~\ref{t:MLDC2}. An example of a typical Challenge 2.2 data set is shown in Figure~\ref{f:C2.2}. As the data sets 2.1 and 2.2 contains millions of sources, the Task Force has identified 4 frequency bands on which the analysis should concentrate first for galactic binaries, and over which the evaluation of the results will be carried out in much depth: the windows  0.2985 $\le f \le$ 0.3015, 0.9985 mHz $\le f \le$ 1.0015 mHz, 2.9985 mHz $\le f \le$ 3.0015 mHz, and 5.9985 mHz $\le f \le$ 6.0015 mHz.

As in the first round of challenges, several data sets are released: the proper challenge data sets, where the source parameters are unknown, and training data sets, with GW signals of similar nature to those included in the blind tests, but whose parameters are made public. The training data sets come also in two flavors: "noisy" data sets and noise-free data sets, the latter containing exactly the same GW signal(s) as those present in the noisy set. Notice also that, in order to facilitate the development and testing of analysis schemes, Challenge 2.1 and 2.2 training data set will contain the same realization of the galaxy, so that the signals from the population of stellar-mass binary systems are identical in the two sets. Of course, this will not be the case for the challenge sets. 

For each challange data set the three TDI channels $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are distributed through the MLDC website~\cite{MLDCweb}. The format in which the MLDC data sets are encoded is implemented using XML (the eXtensible Markup Language), a simple, flexible and widely used text format related to HTM~\cite{xml}. There are extended software libraries to handle XML that are readily available. The XML implementation of the MLDC file format (known as lisaXML) is based on XSIL (the eXtensible Scientific Interchange Language) \cite{xsil}. There are a number of dedicated software tools to read and write lisaXML files (for C/C++, Pyhthon, MATLAB and ASCII) developed by the MLDC Task Force and available in the LISA Tools Subversion archive~\cite{lisatools}. The whole software for the data production pipelines -- a detailed "How To" for Challenge 2 is also posted on the Task Force wiki~\cite{MLDCwiki} -- including waveform generation functions(described in the next sections), as well as a variety of other software tools useful to analyze MLDC data sets is also available in the same repository.

The generation of the data sets is responsibility of one member of the Task Force who does not take part in Challenge 2. The deadline for submission of results (again through the MLDC website) is June 15th, 2007. The Task Force plans to process the results and provide an initial summary and evauation of this round within about a month from then.

\section{Modeling of LISA: Pseudo-LISA}
\label{s:lisa}

We have developed a set of conventions to describe the LISA orbit and response, that constitute the \emph{pseudo-LISA} adopted in Challenge 1 and 2. The pseudo-LISA orbits are obtained by truncating exact Keplerian orbits for a point mass orbiting the Sun to first order in the eccentricity (see the Appendix of~\cite{lisasimulator}). The two simulators used for the generation of the data sets -- the LISA Simulator \cite{lisasimulator} and Synthetic LISA \cite{synthlisa} -- comply with these assumptions, and adhere to these conventions. In Solar-System Barycentric (SSB) coordinates (with the $x$ axis aligned with the vernal point), we set
%
\begin{eqnarray}
x_n &=& a\cos \alpha + a \, e\left(\sin\alpha\cos\alpha\sin\beta_n
-(1+\sin^2\alpha)\cos\beta_n\right), \nonumber \\
y_n &=& a\sin \alpha + a \, e\left(\sin\alpha\cos\alpha\cos\beta_n
-(1+\cos^2\alpha)\sin\beta_n\right), \\
z_n & = & -\sqrt{3} \, a \, e \cos(\alpha-\beta_n) \, , \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\beta_n = (n-1)\times2\pi/3 + \lambda$ ($n=1, 2, 3$) is the relative orbital phase of the $n$-th spacecraft, $a = 1$ AU is the semi-major axis of the guiding center, and $\alpha(t)=2 \pi \, t / (1 \mathrm{year}) + \kappa$ is its orbital phase and $t$ is time measured at the SSB. In this approximation, the spacecraft form a rigid equilateral triangle with side length $L = 2\sqrt{3} \, a \, e = 5\times 10^6$ km for $e=0.00965$. (In fact, the LISA Simulator and Synthetic LISA implement $e^2$-accurate orbits, but the additional terms make very little difference to the instrument response.) The parameters $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ (\texttt{InitialPosition} and \texttt{InitialRotation} in lisaXML) set the initial location and orientation of the LISA constellation; in Challenge 1, $\kappa=\lambda=0$. This choice places LISA at the vernal point, with spacecraft 1 directly below the guiding center in the southern ecliptic hemisphere (see~\ref{MLDCdoc} for expressions to convert to other LISA orbit specifications).

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Common source parameters. Note that in the initial challenges we do not deal explicitly with the redshifting of sources at cosmological distances; thus, $D$ is a \emph{luminosity} distance, and the masses and frequencies of Tables \ref{tab:bbh} are those measured at the SSB, which are red/blue-shifted by factors $(1+z)^{\pm 1}$ w.r.t. to those measured locally near the sources.\label{tab:common}}
\end{table}

The one-way links between adjacent space-craft that are necessary to built the LISA response to GWs are either the phase response $\Phi_{ij}$ -- as employed in the LISA Simulator, see Sec.\ II of~\cite{lisasimulator} -- or the fractional frequency response $y^\mathrm{gw}_{slr}$, as used in Synthetic LISA, see Sec.\ II B in~\cite{synthlisa}. The TDI Rosetta Stone~\cite{rosetta} provides details for translations between index notations. The phase and fractional-frequency formalisms are equivalent, and are related by a simple time integration\footnote{\emph{LISA Simulator} produces \emph{equivalent-strain} data, with a nominal length of $L_n = 10^{10}$ m; to convert equivalent strain to fractional frequency one needs to differentiate and multiply by $2 \pi L_n / c$.}.

LISA employs Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) to suppress the otherwise overwhelming laser phase noise, see~\cite{firstgen,modified,secondgen} and references therein. TDI observables are constructed from time-delayed linear combinations of one-way links, and they represent synthesized interferometers where laser phase fluctuations move in closed paths across the LISA arms. More complicated paths are required to deal with the variations of the armlengths, giving rise to the three TDI ``generations". For the initial MLDCs,  \emph{TDI 1.5} observables \cite{modified,secondgen} are adopted. In particular the data sets are the unequal-arm Michelson observables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ defined in~\cite{secondgen}. Strictly speaking, TDI 2.0 would be required to cancel laser noise completely in a rotating and flexing LISA array such as the current pseudo-LISA. The difference between TDI 1.5 and 2.0 is negligible for the response to GW signals, but it requires a more complex  numerical treatment of one-way links, adding un-necessary complexity to the GW analysis which is the goal of the MLDC. Thus, Challenge data sets 1 and 2 contain TDI 1.5 observables without laser noise.

The model of the LISA instrumental noise $S_\mathrm{in}$ adopted in Challenge 2 is identical to that considered for Challenge 1. It includes contributions from optical noise, assumed white in phase, with one-sided spectral density
\be
S_\mathrm{opt}^{1/2}(f) = 20 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}\,,
\ee
and from acceleration noise (assumed white in acceleration, but increasing as $1/f$ below $10^{-4}$ Hz), with one-sided spectral density 
\be
S_\mathrm{acc}^{1/2}(f) = 3 \times 10^{-15} [1 + (10^{-4}\,{\rm Hz}/f)^2]^{1/2}\, \mathrm{m}\, \mathrm{s}^{-2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}\,;
\ee
the total noise contribution is then simply $S_\mathrm{in} = S_\mathrm{opt}(f) + S_\mathrm{acc}(f)$. As we have mentioned above, the laser phase noise is assumed to be zero. The six optical noises and six acceleration noises (for the two optical benches on each spacecraft) are modeled as independent Gaussian random processes, and are realized in practice with sequences of pseudo-random numbers. Specifically, Synthetic LISA generates independent Gaussian deviates (i.e., white noise) in the time domain, and then filters them digitally to obtain the desired spectral shape; the LISA Simulator generates independent Gaussian deviates in the frequency domain, multiplies them by $S^{1/2}(f)$, and FFTs to the time domain.

\section{Gravitational waveforms}

In this section we describe the conventions adopted to describe the gravitational waveforms and the assumptions made on the signals to construct the data sets. They are identical to those adopted in Challenge 1. Here we introduce two new ingredients: the model of the Galaxy used to simulate a populations of stellar-mass binaries and the kludge EMRI waveforms.

\subsection{Gravitational wave polarizations}
\label{ss:polarizations}

The sky location of a GW source is described in J2000 \emph{ecliptic coordinates}: latitude $\beta$ and longitude $\lambda$, the latter measured from the vernal point, aligned with the $\hat{x}$ axis in our convention. Gravitational radiation travels along the direction $\hat{k} = -(\cos \beta \cos \lambda, \cos \beta \sin \lambda, \sin \beta)$, with surfaces of constant phase given by $\xi = t - \hat{k} \cdot x$. In the transverse--traceless gauge, the gravitational strain tensor can be decomposed in two polarization states $h_{+}(\xi)$ and $h_{\times}(\xi)$ and is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:defpol}
\mathbf{h}(\xi) = h_{+}(\xi) \left[ \hat{u}\otimes \hat{u} - \hat{v}\otimes \hat{v} \right] + h_{\times}(\xi) \left[ \hat{u}\otimes \hat{v} + \hat{v}\otimes \hat{u} \right]\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{u} = \partial \hat{k} / \partial{\beta}$, $\hat{v} \propto \partial \hat{k} / \partial{\lambda}$. Thus, GWs from any MLDC source are completely specified by $\beta$, $\lambda$, and by the two functions $h_+(\xi)$ and $h_\times(\xi)$ for the source's GW polarization amplitudes, measured at the SSB.

The orbital orientation of nonprecessing binaries is described by the inclination $\iota$ (the angle between the line of sight $-\hat{k}$ and the orbital angular momentum of the binary), and by their polarization angle $\psi$: specifically, if $h^S_{+}(\xi)$ and $h^S_\times(\xi)$ are the binary's GW polarizations in the source frame (i.e., defined with respect to the binary's \emph{principal polarization axes} $\hat{p}$ and $\hat{q}$) then 
%
\begin{equation}
h_+(\xi) + i h_\times(\xi) = e^{-2 i \psi} \left[ h^S_+(\xi) + i h^S_\times(\xi) \right],
\end{equation}
%
with $\psi = -\arctan(\hat{v} \cdot \hat{p} / \hat{u} \cdot \hat{p})$.
Together with $\beta$, $\lambda$, and with the luminosity distance $D$, $\iota$ and $\psi$ form a set of common standard parameters, listed in Tab.\ \ref{tab:common} with their standard lisaXML (see~\cite{} for a description of the XML files adopted for the MLDCs).

\subsection{Galactic stellar mass binaries}
\label{ss:WD}

In Challenge 2, a galactic stellar mass binary system of two stars of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ at distance $D$  is modelled as a binary of are modeled as point masses in circular orbit with constant period. The source-frame polarization amplitudes are given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h^S_+(\xi)  & = & \mathcal{A} \left(1 + \cos^2{\iota}\right) \cos(2\pi f \xi + \phi_0), \\
h^S_\times(\xi) & = & -2 \mathcal{A} (\cos{\iota}) \sin(2\pi f \xi + \phi_0). \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the amplitude is derived from the physical parameters of a source $\mathcal{A} = (2 \mu / D) (\pi M f)^{2/3}$ (notice that $f$ is constant in the SSB), with $M = m_1 + m_2$ the total mass, and $\mu = m_1 + m_2$ the reduced mass; $ \phi_0$ is an arbitrary random initial phase. A Challenge-2 \texttt{GalacticBinary} source is completely determined by the parameters of Tables \ref{tab:common} and \ref{tab:galactic} together. %
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
{Parameter} &
{Symbol} &
{Standard parameter name} &
{Standard unit} \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\texttt{GalacticBinary} source parameters. Note that \texttt{Amplitude} effectively replaces the standard \texttt{Distance} parameter.\label{tab:galactic}}
\end{table}
The data sets contain 20 "verification binaries". For the MLDC we define as verification binaries systems whose location and orbital period are exactly know. The remaining 4 parameters are selected randomly. We consider 5 real known systems and then select from the galaxy model. Notice that for the training data sets 2.1 and 2.2 the verification binaries, as well as all the other binaries are the same. For the challenge data sets,this is not the case. Only the known parameters of the verification binaries remain the same. 

The parameters -- masses, distance and location in the sky -- of each individual binary are drawn from a synthetic model of the Galaxy, which is discussed in the next section. The other parameters are selected randomly.

\subsection{Galactic model}
\label{ss:galaxy}
[{\bf IS THIS WHAT WE ARE USING?}]

In constructing the Challenge data sets, the galactic binary parameters are chosen at random based on our model Galactic population density. The bulk properties of the Galaxy can be broken down into morphology and composition. The morphology of a Galaxy is best described in terms of a population density function. Two population densities are currently considered in the literature. The double exponential used by Hils, Bender \& Webbink (1990) and Timpano, Rubbo \& Cornish (2005) is described entirely by central density, $\rho_0$, radial scale, $R_0$, and scale height, $z_0$, and has the form (in Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates):
\begin{equation}
\rho({\bf r}) = \rho_0 e^{-R/R_0} e^{-z/z_0}. 
\end{equation}
The ``cuspy'' exponential-${\rm sech}^2$ used by Nelemans {\it et al.} (2001), Benacquista, DeGoes \& Lunder (2004), and Edlund {\it et al.} (2005) includes the possibility for a central cusp and so has an additional parameter $c$:
\be
\rho({\bf r}) = \rho_0 r^{-c} e^{-R/R_0} {\rm sech}^2(-z/z_0).
\label{e:rho_BLT}
\ee
In the current usage, $0\le c \le 1$, although any real number within this range is acceptable. The total number of binaries $N$ is related to $\rho_0$ and can be found by integrating the density over all space.

The composition of the Galaxy is best described by the separate binary sub-types (e.g.: WD-WD, WD-NS, WD-BH, etc.) which make up the total population of binaries. Since it is quite likely that different sub-types will also have different population density descriptions, the most extensible and efficient way to describe the bulk properties of the Galaxy will be a list of parameters for each sub-type. The parameters will include the sub-type, a flag for the density distribution used, and the values of $N$ (or $\rho_0$), $c$, $R_0$, and $z_0$.

The model of the Galaxy that is used for the MLDC is corresponds to Eq.~(\ref{e:rho_BLT}) with $c = 1$, $R_0 = 2.5~{\rm  kpc}$, and $z_0 = 200~{\rm pc}$. We have restricted  our population to detached double white dwarf binaries. The total number of binaries in the population is $N = 3 \times 10^7$.

\subsection{Massive--black-hole binaries}

In these first two rounds of MLDCs massive-black hole binaries we restrict to circular orbits and non-spinning black holes. We also consider only the in-spiral phase of the whole coalescence. We model the in-spiral at the restricted second post-Newtonian order, following~\cite{Blanchet,DIS}. We first introduce the parameters
\be
\tau =  \frac{\eta}{5M}(t_c - t)
\ee
where $t_c$ is the time at coalescence, and $\eta = \mu/M$. The time-evolution of the \emph{orbital} angular frequency $\omega$ and phase $\Phi$ are then given by
\bea
M\omega &=& \frac{1}{8} \tau^{-3/8}\Biggl\{ 1 + \left( \frac{11}{32}\eta + \frac{743}{2688}\right) 
\tau^{-1/4} - \frac{3}{10}\pi\tau^{-3/8} \nonumber \\
& + & \left(\frac{1855099}{14450688} + \frac{371}{2048}\eta^2 
+ \frac{56975}{258048}\eta\right)
\tau^{-1/2}  \Biggr\}
\label{fr}
\eea
and
\bea
\Phi &=& -\frac{1}{32\eta}(M\omega)^{-5/3}\Biggl\{ 1 + \left( \frac{3715}{1008} + \frac{55}{12}\eta\right)
(M\omega)^{2/3} - 10\pi(M\omega)  \nonumber \\
&+&  \left( \frac{15293365}{1016064} + \frac{27145}{1008}\eta + \frac{3085}{144}\eta^2\right)
(M\omega)^{4/3}\Biggr\} + \mathrm{const.}
\label{eq:Phi}
\eea
respectively. The arbitrary constant entering the definition~(\ref{eq:Phi}) is set to $\Phi_0$ at the time corresponding to $t = 0$. 

In the source reference frame, the polarization waveforms are given by:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h^S_{+}(\xi) &=& \frac{2\mu}{D}[M\omega(\xi)]^{2/3}(1+\cos^2 \iota)\cos [2\Phi(\xi)], \\
h^S_{\times}(\xi) &=& -\frac{2\mu}{D}[M\omega(\xi)]^{2/3}(2 \cos \iota) \sin [2\Phi(\xi)]. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
In order to avoid numerical artifacts at the time when the in-spiral terminates, we taper the signal according to:
%
\begin{equation}
w(t) = \frac{1}{2}\,\left( 1 + \tanh\left[A (M/R - M/R_\mathrm{taper})\right] \right)\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $R$ is approximated with Kepler's law ($R = M^{1/3} \omega^{-2/3}$), and
where the dimensionless coefficient $A = 150$ was determined empirically to produce smooth damping.

\subsection{Extreme--Mass-Ratio Inspirals}

Extreme--Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) -- a compact object (CO) orbiting a MBH -- are the new source class included in the second round of MLDCs. The EMRI waveforms adopted are the Barack--Cutler ``analytic kludge'' waveforms \cite{BC}: the orbits are instantaneously approximated as Newtonian ellipses and gravitational radiation is given by the corresponding Peters--Matthews formula \cite{pm}, but perihelion direction, orbital plane, semi-major axis, and eccentricity evolve according to post-Newtonian equations. While these waveforms are not particularly accurate in the highly relativistic regime of interest for real EMRI searches, they do exhibit the main qualitative features of the true waveforms, and they are considerably simpler to generate.  They are therefore ideal to develop and test search strategies. It is expected that any search strategy that works for them could be modified fairly easily to deal with the true general-relativistic waveforms, once these become available.

The two-body system in general relativity is described by 17 parameters. Here we assume that the spin of the CO is negligible with respect to the MBH's spin and can therefore be ignored: the signal is described by only 14 parmeters, that we now describe. Let us consider a CO of mass $\mu (\ll M)$ orbiting a MBH of mass $M$ on an orbit with semi-major axis $a$, eccentricity $e$ and \emph{orbital} frequency $\nu$. At the Newtonian order,  $\nu = (2\pi M)^{-1} (M/a)^{3/2}$ and the \emph{orbital} mean anomaly $\Phi$, i.e., the average orbital phase with respect to the direction of pericenter, is $\Phi(t) = 2\pi\nu (t-t_0) +\Phi_0$, where  $\Phi_0$ is the mean anomaly at $t_0$. The spin $\vec S$ of the MBH is parametrized by its magnitude $S$ (so that $0 \le S/M^2 \le 1$) and the two polar angles $\theta_K,\phi_K$ in the SSB (here "K" stands for Kerr). $\vec L(t)$ represents the time-varying orbital angular momentum; its direction is parametrized by the \emph{constant} angle $\lambda$ (not to be confused with the ecliptic longitude, defined in Sec~\ref{ss:polarizations}) between $\vec L$ and $\vec S$%
\footnote{In reality, radiation reaction will impose a small time variation in $\lambda$; however, this variation is known to be very small, see~\cite{scott1}, and is neglected here},%
and by an azimuthal angle $\alpha(t)$, {\em i.e.} it describes the direction of $\hat L$ around $\hat S$. The angle $\tilde\gamma(t)$ is the (intrinsic) direction of pericenter, measured with respect to $\vec L\times\vec S$. Considering a given time $t_0$ (as measured in the SSB), $\nu_0$, $e_0$, $\tilde\gamma_0$, and $\Phi_0$ describe, respectively, the eccentricity, the direction of the pericenter within the orbital plane, and the mean anomaly at that given time. More specifically, $\tilde\gamma_0$ is the angle in the plane of the orbit from $\hat L \times \hat S$ to pericenter, $\Phi_0$ to be the mean anomaly with respect to pericenter passage. We refer the reader to Figure ... of Ref.~\cite{BC} for a graphic representation of the system.

It is useful to describe the gravitational wave tensor in a time-varying frame defined with respect to the unit vector ${\hat n} = -{\hat k}$ pointing from the origin of the SSB to the source and ${ \hat L}(t)$. Defining the unit vectors 
${ \hat p}$ and ${ \hat q}$ by
\begin{eqnarray} \label{pq}
{ \hat p} &\equiv& ({ \hat n}\times { \hat L})/
                    |{ \hat n}\times { \hat L}|, \nonumber\\
{ \hat q} &\equiv& { \hat p} \times { \hat n}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
the general GW strain field at the SSB can then be written as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hab}
\mathbf{h}(\xi) = h_{+}(\xi) \left[ \hat{p}\otimes \hat{p} - \hat{q}\otimes \hat{q} \right] + h_{\times}(\xi) \left[ \hat{p}\otimes \hat{q} + \hat{q}\otimes \hat{p} \right]\,.
\end{equation}
%
Notice that the two polarization basis tensors $[ \hat{p}\otimes \hat{p} - \hat{q}\otimes \hat{q}]$  and $[ \hat{p}\otimes \hat{p} - \hat{q}\otimes \hat{q}]$ are function of time. 
One can decompose Eq.\ (\ref{eq;hab}) into $n$-harmonic contributions at integer multiples of the orbital frequency as:
\be
h_{+}\equiv \sum_n A^{+}_n \quad h_{\times}\equiv \sum_n A^{\times}_n \,,
\label{harmonics}
\ee
where the $A^{+,\times}_n$ are
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\begin{eqnarray} \label{A}
A^{+}_n &=&-[1+({ \hat L}\cdot{ \hat n})^2]\left[
a_n\cos(2\gamma)-b_n\sin(2\gamma)\right]
+[1-({ \hat L}\cdot{ \hat n})^2]c_n, \nonumber\\
A^{\times}_n&=& 2({ \hat L}\cdot{ \hat n})\left[
b_n \cos(2\gamma)+a_n \sin(2\gamma)\right]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The harmonics $A^{+,\times}_n$ are expressed as a function of the coefficients
\begin{eqnarray} \label{abc}
a_n &=& - n{\cal A}\bigl[J_{n-2}(ne)-2eJ_{n-1}(ne) \nonumber \\
       && +(2/n)J_n(ne) +2eJ_{n+1}(ne)-J_{n+2}(ne)\bigr]\cos[n\Phi(t)],
\nonumber\\
b_n &=& - n{\cal A}(1-e^2)^{1/2}\bigl[J_{n-2}(ne)-2J_{n}(ne)
+J_{n+2}(ne)\bigr]\sin[n \Phi(t)],
\nonumber\\
c_n &=& 2{\cal A}J_n(ne)\cos[n\Phi(t)]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
In the previous expressions $\gamma$ is an azimuthal angle measuring the direction of pericenter with respect to $\hat x \equiv [-\hat n + \hat L (\hat L\cdot \hat n)]/[1-(\hat L\cdot \hat n)^2]^{1/2}$ and $J_n$ are Bessel functions of the first kind. The overall amplitude is given by
\begin{equation} \label{calA}
{\cal A}\equiv (2\pi \nu M)^{2/3}\frac{\mu}{D}\,.
\end{equation}
In practice, we truncate the sums in Eq.~(\ref{harmonics}) at $n=20$.


The angular momenum direction vector $\hat L$ is not constant, since $\hat L$ precesses about the MBH's spin
direction $\hat S$.  Let $\theta_L(t),\phi_L(t)$ be the angles specifying the instantaneous direction of $\hat L$, and let $\hat z$ be a unit vector normal to the ecliptic. One then obtains
\be \label{alpha}
\hat L = \hat S \, \cos\lambda +
\frac{\hat z - \hat S \cos\theta_K}{\sin\theta_K} \sin\lambda \cos\alpha
+ \frac{\hat S \times \hat z}{\sin\theta_K}  \, \sin\lambda \sin\alpha\,,
\ee
\noindent
and the angles $\theta_L(t),\phi_L(t)$ are given in terms of $\theta_K$, $\phi_K$,$\lambda$, $\alpha(t)$ by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{relations3}
\cos\theta_L(t) &=& \cos\theta_K \cos\lambda
    +\sin\theta_K\sin\lambda\cos\alpha(t), \nonumber\\
\sin\theta_L(t)\cos\phi_L(t) &=&
\sin\theta_K\cos\phi_K\cos\lambda \nonumber \\
& & -\cos\phi_K\cos\theta_K\sin\lambda\cos\alpha(t)
+\sin\phi_K\sin\lambda\sin\alpha(t),  \nonumber\\
\sin\theta_L(t)\sin\phi_L(t) &=&
\sin\theta_K\sin\phi_K\cos\lambda \nonumber \\
& & -\sin\phi_K\cos\theta_K\sin\lambda\cos\alpha(t)
-\cos\phi_K\sin\lambda\sin\alpha(t) .
\end{eqnarray}

The angle $\gamma$ that appears in Eqs.\ (\ref{A}) measures the direction of pericenter with respect to
$\hat x \equiv [-\hat n + \hat L (\hat L\cdot \hat n)]/[1-(\hat L\cdot \hat n)^2]^{1/2}$. It is convenient (see the discussion in~\cite{BC}) to define $\tilde\gamma$ to be the direction of pericenter with respect to $\hat L \times \hat S$; $\gamma$  and $\tilde \gamma$ are related by
\be
\label{beta}
\gamma = \tilde\gamma + \beta,
\ee
where $\beta$ is the angle from $\hat x \propto [\hat L(\hat L \cdot \hat n) \hat n] $ to $(\hat L \times \hat S)$, and is identified by:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{sinbeta}
\sin\beta &=& \frac{\cos\lambda\, \hat L\cdot\hat n -\hat S\cdot \hat n }
{\sin\lambda\bigl[1 - (\hat L\cdot\hat n)^2\bigr]^{1/2}}, \nonumber \\
\cos\beta &=& \frac{\hat n \cdot (\hat S \times \hat L)}
{\sin\lambda\bigl[1 - (\hat L\cdot\hat n)^2\bigr]^{1/2} }.
\end{eqnarray}
The angle $\beta(t)$ is time dependent, and, to evaluate the above expressions, the following relations are useful:
\be
\label{SdotN}
{ \hat S}\cdot{ \hat n} = \cos\theta_S \cos\theta_K
+ \sin\theta_S \sin\theta_K \cos(\phi_S-\phi_K),
\ee
\bea\label{ScrossLdotN}
\hat n \cdot (\hat S \times \hat L) & = &
\sin\theta_S \sin(\phi_K-\phi_S)\sin\lambda \cos\alpha \nonumber \\
& &+ \frac{\hat S\cdot\hat n \cos\theta_K -\cos\theta_S}{\sin\theta_K}
\, \sin\lambda \sin\alpha,
\eea
and
\bea
\label{LdotN}
{ \hat L}\cdot{ \hat n} & = & { \hat S}\cdot{ \hat n}\cos\lambda
+ \frac{\cos\theta_S - \hat S\cdot\hat n \cos\theta_K}{\sin\theta_K}
\, \sin\lambda \cos\alpha \nonumber \\
& & + \frac{(\hat S \times \bar z)\cdot \hat n}
{\sin\theta_K}  \, \sin\lambda \sin\alpha\,, \nonumber \\
& = & \cos\theta_S \cos\theta_L +
\sin\theta_S \sin\theta_L \cos(\phi_S-\phi_L).
\eea
Note that the time-variation of ${ \hat S}\cdot{ \hat n}$ is very small in the extreme mass-ratio case considered here, and in our kludged approximation we approximate $\hat S$---and hence ${\hat S}\cdot{\hat n}$---as strictly constant.

The evolution of $\Phi(t)$, $\nu(t)$, $\tilde\gamma(t)$, $e(t)$, and $\alpha(t)$ is given by the following PN formulae:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} &=& 2\pi\nu, \label{Phidot} \\
\frac{d\nu}{dt} &=&
\frac{96}{10\pi}(\mu/M^3)(2\pi M\nu)^{11/3}(1-e^2)^{-9/2}
\bigl\{
\left[1+(73/24)e^2+(37/96)e^4\right](1-e^2) \nonumber \\
&&+ (2\pi M\nu)^{2/3}\left[(1273/336)-(2561/224)e^2-(3885/128)e^4
-(13147/5376)e^6 \right] \nonumber \\
&&- (2\pi M\nu)(S/M^2)\cos\lambda (1-e^2)^{-1/2}\bigl[(73/12)
+ (1211/24)e^2 \nonumber \\
&&+(3143/96)e^4 +(65/64)e^6 \bigr]
\bigr\}, \label{nudot} \\
%
\frac{d\tilde\gamma}{dt} &=& 6\pi\nu(2\pi\nu M)^{2/3} (1-e^2)^{-1}
\left[1+\frac{1}{4}(2\pi\nu M)^{2/3} (1-e^2)^{-1}(26-15e^2)\right] \nonumber \\
&&-12\pi\nu\cos\lambda (S/M^2) (2\pi M\nu)(1-e^2)^{-3/2},
\label{Gamdot} \\
%
\frac{de}{dt}  &=& -\frac{e}{15}(\mu/M^2) (1-e^2)^{-7/2} (2\pi M\nu)^{8/3}
\bigl[(304+121e^2)(1-e^2)\bigl(1 + 12 (2\pi M\nu)^{2/3}\bigr) \, \nonumber \\
&&- \frac{1}{56}(2\pi M\nu)^{2/3}\bigl( (8)(16705) + (12)(9082)e^2 - 25211e^4 \bigr)\bigr]\,
\nonumber \\
&&+ e (\mu/M^2)(S/M^2)\cos\lambda\,(2\pi M\nu)^{11/3}(1-e^2)^{-4}
\, \bigl[(1364/5) + (5032/15)e^2 + (263/10)e^4\bigr] ,
\label{edot} \\
%
\frac{d\alpha}{dt} &=& 4\pi\nu (S/M^2) (2\pi M\nu)(1-e^2)^{-3/2}.
\label{alphadot}
\end{eqnarray}
In solving the above time-evolution equations, the initial values (at time $t_0$) of $\Phi$, $\nu$, $\tilde\gamma$, $e$, and $\alpha$ are just the parameters $\Phi_0$, $\nu_0$, $\tilde\gamma_0$, $e_0$, and $\alpha_0$. We use our PN Eqs.~(\ref{edot}) and (\ref{nudot}) to evolve $e(t)$ and $\nu(t)$. For a point particle in Schwarzschild, the plunge occurs at
$a_{\rm min} = M (6 + 2e)(1-e^2)^{-1}$~\cite{Cutler-Kennefick-Poisson},
so we set
\be\label{numax}
\nu_{\rm max} = (2\pi M)^{-1}[(1-e^2)/(6 + 2e)]^{3/2} \, ,
\ee
and we shut-off the waveform when $\nu$ reaches this $\nu_{\rm max}$.

Eq.~(\ref{hab}) express the waveform in terms of time-varying polarization tensors. However to generate the LISA responses it is necessary to re-express Eq.~(\ref{hab}) in terms of fixed polarization tensors. This achieved through a rotation by the polarization angle
\begin{equation}\label{psiSL}
\psi = \mathrm{arctan}\left(\frac{\sin\theta_L \sin(\phi_S-\phi_L)}{\cos \theta_S \sin \theta_L \cos(\phi_S - \phi_L) - \cos\theta_L \sin\theta_S}\right) - \psi_0\,.
\end{equation}

The algorithm for constructing the MLDC EMRI waveforms works as follows. One fixes a fiducial frequency $\nu_0$ and choose the waveform parameters $t_0,\,\ln\mu,\,\ln M,\,S/M^2,\,e_0,\,\tilde\gamma_0,\,\Phi_0,\,\cos\theta_S,\,\phi_S,\,\cos\lambda,\,\alpha_0,\cos\theta_K,\,\phi_K,\psi_0,D$. One then (i) solves the ODEs (\ref{Phidot})--(\ref{alphadot}) for $\Phi(t)$, $\nu(t)$, $\tilde\gamma(t)$, $e(t)$, $\alpha(t)$; (ii) uses $e(t)$ and $\nu(t)$ to calculate $a_n(t), b_n(t), c_n(t)$ in Eqs.~(\ref{abc}); (iii) calculates $\theta_L(t),\phi_L(t)$ using Eqs.~(\ref{relations3}), and then $\gamma(t)$ from $\tilde\gamma(t)$ using Eqs.~(\ref{beta})--(\ref{2LdotN}); (iv) computes the amplitude coefficients $A_n^{+,\times}$  using Eqs.~(\ref{A}) and (\ref{LdotN}); (v) calculates $\psi$ using Eq.~(\ref{psiSL}) and (iv) finally $h_{+,\times}(t)$ using
Eqs.~(\ref{final}).

Challange 2 


Another source of complexity that we wish to exclude from the initial challenges is the uncertainty about the true shape of the gravitational waveforms that Nature will provide to LISA. However, we can already begin prepare for their detection and analysis, while waiting for theory to provide more and more accurate models, by working with fully known waveforms of comparable structure and increasing complexity.

 The challenge data sets are broadly grouped into three categories: (1.1) white dwarf binaries (WDs), (1.2) supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and (1.3) extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The problem of detection of EMRIs is considered more difficult than the others, so the deadline for submission of results for the 1.3 challenges is extended to June, 2007. Consequently, in this paper we will discuss the results of challenges 1.1 and 1.2.


involve the distribution of several data sets, encoded in a simple standard format, and containing combinations of realistic simulated LISA noise with the signals from one or more GW sources with parameters which were unknown to the participants. The participants were then asked to return the maximum amount of correct information about the sources and to produce technical notes detailing their work.

The release of the first round of challenge data sets was announced in June, 2006 at the Sixth LISA International Symposium hosted by the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. John Baker (a member of the MLDC Task Force who did not participate in the first round) was appointed as MLDC1 coordinator. The coordinator was responsible for generating the challenge data sets, receiving the results from the participants, and posting both the key data files and results as soon as possible after the submission deadline of December 4, 2006.


The WD challenges consist of three single source data sets with the GW frequency around 1 mHz (1.1.1a), 3 mHz (1.1.1b) and 10 mHz (1.1.1c) and four multiple source data sets with isolated sources of known (1.1.2) and unknown (1.1.3) sky locations and frequencies, and overlapping sources with a low (1.1.4) and high (1.1.5) density of sources in frequency space. The SMBH challenges consist of two single source data sets. In one (1.2.1) the SMBH binary merges during the observation time, and in the other (1.2.2) the merger takes place a few months after the end of the data set.
