1) Code name (as you want it to be listed in tables and in the text)


PhenomC (I think)

People/groups who contributed


Stas Babak, Antoine Petiteau, Frank Ohme, Emma Robinson

References to relevant published literature with a detailed description
of the code

2) PN order in phasing

Phenomenological waveform: joining inspiral and merger + ringdown.


3) PN amplitude corrections/higher harmonics? (Yes/No)


No

* if yes, to what order? did you Taylor re-expand the amplitude?
(give details...)

4) Spins in inspiral phasing/amplitude? (Yes/No)


Spin (alligned) in the phase, not in the amplitude.

5) Spin precession during inspiral? (Yes/No)

No.


6) Eccentricity? (Yes/No)


No.

7) Merger/ringdown? (Yes/No)

* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomA/B/C, IRS...)


Yes, phenomC

* if yes, does the model allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?


Yes. Mass ratio was restricted to the 1:50 and individual spins to 0.98.
Higher mass ratio (i) were not tested with this model (ii) give clearly wrong results
Higher mass could lead to final spin >1 as estimated by empirical formula.

* did you make assumptions on the LISA response during merger?


Rigid adiabatic approximation +  Static LISA.

8) Higher harmonics in merger/ringdown? (yes/no)


no.

* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomX...)

* if yes, does it allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?

9) LISA response model

Please give a short description or refer to a published paper.


Rigid adiabatic approximation was used in models C-type (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)
During the inspiral we connect time and frequency of GW via 3PN expression t(f).
Close to the inspiral we keep LISA fix in calculating the response. For C-type
configurations we have assumed equal arms and analytic (LISA-type orbit).

For L-configuration, we have used actual numerical orbit and corresponding
armlength + adiabatic approximation as above.

* if you work in the frequency domain: please give details (e.g. explain
lower/upper limits of integration, PSD you used and so on; I assume we
are all using the PSDs in the wiki, but I'd like to make sure);


It was done in frequency domain.
fMin = 1.e-5 Hz;
fMax = 1.0 Hz;

or freq  <  0.15 M (as suggested in orig. PhenomC paper)

PSD. I have Used michelson X-psd analytic expression with analytic fit of the galactic binary noise
as explained on wiki:
https://lisa-light.aei.mpg.de/bin/view/DetectorConfigurations/NewConfigurations

for L-configuration I have used an average over the whole orbit numerical PSD (see the same wiki page)


* if you work in the time domain: give details (e.g. explain your
tapering method);

10) Alternative theories? (Yes/No)


No.

* if yes, please give a short summary of what you included and/or refer
to the relevant paper(s).

Note that here we should be careful in comparing results between
different codes: if we want to report results on alternative theories
from different codes, we should have a consistent "underlying" GR model
(e.g. no spins, no amplitude corrections, inspiral only - but let's
discuss!)

11) I think it would be a good idea for calibration (at least for us -
not sure that we should report this in the Yellow Book) to list PE
accuracy on the following parameters:

M, eta, angular resolution (both axes of the ellipse?),


For the angular resolution I have neglected correlation (ellipse) and just took the
dtheta times dphi (so it is worse case).


For codes that can do this:
spins, eccentricity, final BH mass/spin, ***anything else?***

This comparison should be done on a canonical binary.
I propose to use this "canonical binary":

M_total=1e6Msun;
eta=0.25;
s1=s2=eccentricity=0.;
z=1.0 [Cosmology: Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, h=0.7]

We should also fix location in the sky/direction of orbital angular
momentum, or else provide histograms. Any preference?


To be done.

We may have additional "test binaries" for codes that can handle spin
precession and/or eccentricity.

12) Did you already cross-check your code against other codes?
Which ones, and in which cases?

Fisher computations were checked with inspiral only (if it counts as a test).
The waveform was validated by cross comparison of several
implementations.

Please let me know if you need further info.

The code is in free access on lisasolve repository (google code).

Cheers,
Stas.
