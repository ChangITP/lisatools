In terms of the massive black hole waveforms, at APC we are running
MCMCs on the catalogues using two waveform families.  The first with
my student Jerome Carre is an inspiral waveform with higher harmonics
and no spin.  The phase is at the 3.5 PN order and the harmonic
corrections are up to 2.5 PN.

The other waveform is a non-spinning eccentric inspiral.  For this
waveform both the conservative orbital dynamics and the radiation
reaction terms are at 3 PN order.
