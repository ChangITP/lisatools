Dear all,

I think it's time to start assembling the SMBH PE section of the Yellow
Book. Neil and I are the "section captains", and we'd like to collect
some information at this stage.

Please, if you are involved in SMBH parameter estimation, answer the
following "questionnaire" and send it by email to me and Neil:

berti@wugrav.wustl.edu
cornish@physics.montana.edu

Here is the information we need:

1) Code name (as you want it to be listed in tables and in the text)

People/groups who contributed

References to relevant published literature with a detailed description
of the code

2) PN order in phasing

3) PN amplitude corrections/higher harmonics? (Yes/No)

* if yes, to what order? did you Taylor re-expand the amplitude?
(give details...)

4) Spins in inspiral phasing/amplitude? (Yes/No)

5) Spin precession during inspiral? (Yes/No)

6) Eccentricity? (Yes/No)

7) Merger/ringdown? (Yes/No)

* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomA/B/C, IRS...)

* if yes, does the model allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?

* did you make assumptions on the LISA response during merger?

8) Higher harmonics in merger/ringdown? (yes/no)

* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomX...)

* if yes, does it allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?

9) LISA response model

Please give a short description or refer to a published paper.

* if you work in the frequency domain: please give details (e.g. explain
lower/upper limits of integration, PSD you used and so on; I assume we
are all using the PSDs in the wiki, but I'd like to make sure);

* if you work in the time domain: give details (e.g. explain your
tapering method);

10) Alternative theories? (Yes/No)

* if yes, please give a short summary of what you included and/or refer
to the relevant paper(s).

Note that here we should be careful in comparing results between
different codes: if we want to report results on alternative theories
from different codes, we should have a consistent "underlying" GR model
(e.g. no spins, no amplitude corrections, inspiral only - but let's
discuss!)

11) I think it would be a good idea for calibration (at least for us -
not sure that we should report this in the Yellow Book) to list PE
accuracy on the following parameters:

M, eta, angular resolution (both axes of the ellipse?),

For codes that can do this:
spins, eccentricity, final BH mass/spin, ***anything else?***

This comparison should be done on a canonical binary.
I propose to use this "canonical binary":

M_total=1e6Msun;
eta=0.25;
s1=s2=eccentricity=0.;
z=1.0 [Cosmology: Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, h=0.7]

We should also fix location in the sky/direction of orbital angular
momentum, or else provide histograms. Any preference?

We may have additional "test binaries" for codes that can handle spin
precession and/or eccentricity.

12) Did you already cross-check your code against other codes?
Which ones, and in which cases?

Finally, it would help us a lot if you can provide a list of references
relevant to understand how your code works, and - even better - a SHORT
(max two paragraphs) writeup with a description of the code.

Once we get a first round of responses (hopefully before the weekend!)
Neil and I will start merging the material.

Also, let us know if there's something that we forgot in the list above.

Thanks!
Emanuele and Neil
