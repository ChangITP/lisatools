Hi Emanuele and Neil,

I start to put some results obtained with the code described in my
previous mail on wiki at

https://lisa-light.aei.mpg.de/bin/view/SMBHBEvaluation/ParametersEstimation

I should have more results tomorrow.

By the way, I miss to give you a code name so I used : 
LC2PrecHHInsp

Best,

Hi Emanuele and Neil,

I attach the description of our work on inspiral precessing high
harmonics waveform for SMBH binaries (
Description_LC2PrecHHInsp-AEI.txt ) .

I also attach a catalogue ( SMBHTestSrc_ext.dat ) of 4 tests sources
that we used and the corresponding results ( FIM-LISA-SMBHTestSrc.txt
) : the first one is almost the canonical binary (s1=s2=0.0001,
eta=0.2499997) and the 3 others are the source 8, 14 & 27 of
realization 1 of catalogue LC.

If needed I can also provide the results for the same catalogue using
lisatools (waveform and detector response).

We have results for LC and LEm catalogues and the catalogues SC and
SEm are almost done.  I still need to make some checking and plots but
I hope to send that in 1 or 2 days.

Stas will provide similar the things for PhenomC results and I will
provide that for the work in progress with Numerical relativity group
at AEI as soon as we will have results

Let me know , if you need more information.

Thanks.

Best,
Antoine
