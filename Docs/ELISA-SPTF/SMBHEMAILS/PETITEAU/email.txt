Dear Monica,

I attach to this mail the graphics that we did with Stas for the figure SNR versus redshift.
The associated data (computed by Stas) are also included ( the columns are z mean_spin0, min_spin0, max_spin0, mean_spin09, min_spin09, max_spin09 ) .
There are two types of graphics, so you can choose (and of course we can do more if you want !).

The corresponding captions are :

+ For figures : 
  SNRz_ELISA_spin00.eps		ELISA(NGO)	spin = 0
  SNRz_ELISA_spin09.eps				ELISA(NGO)	spin = 0.9
  SNRz_LISA_spin00.eps    			LISA		       spin = 0
  SNRz_LISA_spin09.eps 						       LISA	spin = 0.9
"SNR versus redshift for ELISA/LISA obtained using the inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform PhenomC [Santamaria2010] with spin = 0/0.9.
The black line corresponds to the mean value and the grey area to the the distribution, (i.e. low limit corresponds to the minimal SNR and high limit to the maximal one).
These results are based on a catalogue of 15360 sources with parameters randomly chosen in distributions which mix several astrophysical models."

There are not nice but we can improve.

We hope it helps.

Please ask to me and Stas, if you need more informations, change in the figures, formats, etc ...


Best regards,
Antoine
