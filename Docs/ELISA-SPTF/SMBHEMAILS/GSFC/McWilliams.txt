Hi Emanuele and Neil,
Here's the Goddard-Princeton questionairre, with answers beneath each question in bold:

1) Code name (as you want it to be listed in tables and in the text)
calcFisher
People/groups who contributed
Sean McWilliams, Ira Thorpe, Tyson Littenberg, Bernard Kelly, and John Baker
References to relevant published literature with a detailed description
of the code
Sean T. McWilliams, James Ira Thorpe, John G. Baker, and Bernard J. Kelly, Phys. Rev. D 81, 064014 (2010) 

2) PN order in phasing
3.5+ PN (phenomenological 4 PN corrections) 

3) PN amplitude corrections/higher harmonics? (Yes/No)
Yes to both.
* if yes, to what order? did you Taylor re-expand the amplitude?
(give details...)
3 PN amplitude, results use standard Taylor flux (no re-expansion)

4) Spins in inspiral phasing/amplitude? (Yes/No)
Yes to both

5) Spin precession during inspiral? (Yes/No)
No

6) Eccentricity? (Yes/No)
No

7) Merger/ringdown? (Yes/No)
Yes
* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomA/B/C, IRS...)
IRSEOB
* if yes, does the model allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?
Arbitrary mass ratios, individual spins < 0.5
* did you make assumptions on the LISA response during merger?
No, we use the full response as implemented in Synthetic LISA

8) Higher harmonics in merger/ringdown? (yes/no)
Yes
* if yes, what model? (EOB, PhenomX...)
IRSEOB
* if yes, does it allow for unequal mass ratios and spins?
Yes

9) LISA response model
Synthetic LISA
Please give a short description or refer to a published paper.

* if you work in the frequency domain: please give details (e.g. explain
lower/upper limits of integration, PSD you used and so on; I assume we
are all using the PSDs in the wiki, but I'd like to make sure);

* if you work in the time domain: give details (e.g. explain your
tapering method);
Sean T. McWilliams, James Ira Thorpe, John G. Baker, and Bernard J. Kelly, Phys. Rev. D 81, 064014 (2010)

We apply a Hann window over 5 WF cycles of the lowest m-mode present
to the start of the WF, and do not taper the end since the ringdown
effectively does so.

10) Alternative theories? (Yes/No)
No
* if yes, please give a short summary of what you included and/or refer
to the relevant paper(s).

Note that here we should be careful in comparing results between
different codes: if we want to report results on alternative theories
from different codes, we should have a consistent "underlying" GR model
(e.g. no spins, no amplitude corrections, inspiral only - but let's
discuss!)

11) I think it would be a good idea for calibration (at least for us -
not sure that we should report this in the Yellow Book) to list PE
accuracy on the following parameters:

M, eta, angular resolution (both axes of the ellipse?),

For codes that can do this:
spins, eccentricity, final BH mass/spin, ***anything else?***

This comparison should be done on a canonical binary.
I propose to use this "canonical binary":

M_total=1e6Msun;
eta=0.25;
s1=s2=eccentricity=0.;
z=1.0 [Cosmology: Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7, h=0.7]

We should also fix location in the sky/direction of orbital angular
momentum, or else provide histograms. Any preference?

We may have additional "test binaries" for codes that can handle spin
precession and/or eccentricity.

12) Did you already cross-check your code against other codes?
Which ones, and in which cases?

We have compared with the Cornish-Lang-Hughes code for numerous
nonspinning and aligned spin cases.  We find agreement typically
within O(10%) for most parameters, but occasionally some errors will
differ by O(100%) for some cases.  The matrix inversion of
Cornish-Lang-Hughes appears to suffer from instabilities (Ryan Lang,
private communication), so in those cases we compare Fisher matrices.

Finally, it would help us a lot if you can provide a list of references
relevant to understand how your code works, and - even better - a SHORT
(max two paragraphs) writeup with a description of the code.
