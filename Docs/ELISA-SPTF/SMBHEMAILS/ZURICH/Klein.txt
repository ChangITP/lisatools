Hello all,

here are the results for the LC catalog using our code, for the C2-4 links configuration.

It is a 2PN Fourier-domain code which includes spin-induced
precession, higher harmonics, and eccentricity. I will send more
details about it to Emanuele and Neil tomorrow.

The pdf file contains a few histograms, plotting number of systems per
bin and per realization against error, which are fractional for the
masses and luminosity distance, and absolute for the spins and
eccentricity. The last plot should be Omega, the area of the
localization ellipse in square degrees. Strangely you cannot read the
legend in the pdf.

The other one is a data file with columns:
- realization ID
- source ID
- SNR
- fractional error on m1 (the bigger mass)
- fractional error on m2
- absolute error on chi1 (the spin parameter of m1)
- major axis of the localization ellipse of the spin of m1 in radians
- corresponding minor axis
- absolute error on chi2 (the spin parameter of m2)
- major axis of the localization ellipse of the spin of m2 in radians
- corresponding minor axis
- error on merger time in seconds
- major axis of the localization ellipse of the orbital angular momentum in radians
- corresponding minor axis
- fractional error on the luminosity distance
- major axis of the localization ellipse of the system in radians
- corresponding minor axis
- error on the initial angle with respect to periastron in radians
- absolute error on the initial eccentricity
- error on the initial angle of the periastron

I didn't include in the file the systems with an SNR lower than 8.

I will update the files when the last systems are computed, and I'll
send the same for the LE catalog when it is done.

Cheers,
Antoine

Hi Emanuele and Neil,

here is the description of the waveform we're using:

You could call it Zurich code. It was programmed by myself, and
Philippe Jetzer contributed to the theoretical part.

It is 2PN in phasing, includes subdominant harmonics, and the
amplitudes are hybrid between 2PN not Taylor re-expanded, and leading
order (by which I mean ~(dn/dt)^1/2, with dn/dt at 2PN order, the
derivative of the mean anomaly).

Spins are included in the phasing and the amplitudes, and they
precess. There is eccentricity, and no merger/ringdown.

Our code is in the Fourier domain, and we use as limits of integration
10^-5 and 1 Hertz.

The PSDs we use are the ones on the wiki, and the orbits are
analytical LISA-like.

There is no inclusion of alternative theories within this code, but
Cedric Huwyler here in Zurich modified my old code for circular orbits
to add that. It is the same code except that it doesn't include
eccentricity, and the amplitudes are 2PN Taylor re-expanded.

I haven't published yet a description of the code, I'm waiting for
other simulations to complete. But basically, the evolution of the
mean motion and eccentricity is taken from
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0404128 and
http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2046. Using this, we evolve the mean anomaly
and the phase, and use the amplitudes from
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0110100. We then use the stationary phase
approximation to get a Fourier domain waveform.

Please let me know if anything is unclear.

Cheers,
Antoine
