Hi Folks,

Here are some results that combine precession, higher harmonics, merger and ringdown.
The large seed models are something I sent earlier. I now have results for the small, chaotic
model as well. All are for Configuration 2. The red lines are with merger/ringdown and the
blue are without.

It is interesting to see that merger/ringdown is also helping the distance determination of the
small seed case, but not be quite as much as for the large seed case.

I will have the efficient accretion (partially aligned spin results) for the small seed catalog soon.
Then I will run all of them again for Configuration 5.
