\begin{abstract}
The Mock LISA Data Challenges are a program to demonstrate LISA data-analysis capabilities and to encourage their development. Each round of challenges consists of one or more containing simulated instrument noise and gravitational waves from sources of undisclosed parameters. Participants analyze the datasets and report best-fit solutions for the source parameters. Here we present the results of the third challenge, issued in Apr 2008, which demonstrated the positive recovery of signals from chirping Galactic binaries, from spinning supermassive--black-hole binaries (with optimal SNRs between $\sim 10$ and $2000$), from simultaneous extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (SNR of 10--50), from cosmic-string cusps (bursts of SNR 10--100), and from a relatively loud isotropic background ($\Omega_\mathrm{gw} \sim 10^{-11}$, slightly below the LISA instrument noise.

\section{The Mock LISA Data Challenges}

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned NASA--ESA gravitational-wave (GW) observatory sensitive in the $10^{-5}$--$10^{-1}$ Hz range \cite{lisa}. LISA's data will contain superposed signals from millions of sources, including all the binaries in the Galaxies with orbital periods below 10 hours, and massive--black-hole (MBH) binary coalescences out to $z \sim 20$. Thousands of sources will be resolvable individually. The potential for source confusion, as well as the very complex dynamics and waveforms of sources such as extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), suggested the need for a coordinated effort to develop and demonstrate LISA data-analysis capabilities. The Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDCs) began in early 2006 with this very purpose.

The complexity and ambition of the challenges has risen with each round: MLDC 1 \cite{mldclisasymp,mldcgwdaw1} focused on simple sources, isolated or moderately interfering; MLDC 2 \cite{mldcgwdaw2,mldcamaldi2} introduced a Galactic \emph{ensemble} of 26 million binaries (20,000 of which were successfully recovered), as well as the problem of detecting MBH binaries over the Galactic cacophony; MLDC 1B \cite{MLDC3} reprised the first challenge for new research collaborations joining the effort, and saw the first successful detections of EMRI signals. MLDC 3, released in April 2008 and due in April 2009, consisted of five subchallenges that featured more realistic models of previously examined sources (chirping Galactic binaries in MLDC 3.1, spinning MBH binary inspirals in 3.2, superposed EMRIs in 3.3) and entirely new sources (GW bursts from cosmic-string cusps in 3.4, an isotropic stochastic background in 3.5); see \cite{MLDC3} for a detailed discussion. Fifteen collaborations, comprising all the participants listed in the byline, and most task-force members, submitted a total of seventeen entries (all can be found at \url{www.tapir.caltech.edu/~mldc/results3} together with technical notes about search implementation).

In this paper we briefly report on the detection and parameter-estimation performance demonstrated in each entry. Altogether, MLDC 3 showed substantial progress in tackling increasingly difficult data-analysis problems, and introduced new search methods such as nested sampling and sophisticated genetic optimization--Markov Chain hybrids. However, there is certainly room for improvement and further work: fewer Galactic binaries were recovered by the iterative searches employed here than by the multi-source MCMC demonstrated in MLDC 2; MBH binaries and EMRIs were detected with high confidence, but the accurate estimation of their parameters (beyond the dominant ones) was stymied by the complex global structure and the many local maxima of likelihood surfaces. On the bright side, searches for cosmic-string bursts and stochastic backgrounds (admittedly simple problems in the absence of nonstationary or non-Gaussian instrument noise) met no roadblocks.
Section \ref{sec:mldc4} introduces MLDC 4, which is being released as we write (November 2009), with entries due at the end of 2010.

\section{Galactic Binaries (MLDC 3.1)}

Three groups submitted Galactic Binary catalogs:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{BhamUIB} (A collaboration between the University of
Birmingham (UK) and the University of the Balearic Islands (Spain))
A multi-source MCMC algorithm was used to search in three narrow
frequency windows, $0.3 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 0.4 {\rm mHz}$,
$0.9 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 1.0 {\rm mHz}$, and
$1.6 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 1.7 {\rm mHz}$. The MLDC waveform
generator was used. A total of 494 sources were reported.

\item \textbf{AEIRIT} (A collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
(Germany) and the Rochester Institute of Technology (US)). A LIGO-style
hierachical, sequential, ${\cal F}$-statistic match filter search
using frequency domain, rigid-adiabatic templates.
Individual TDI channels are used to generate triggers, and those that
pass a concidence condition are passed to a final, coherent analysis
using noise-orthogonal TDI combinations. A total of 1940 sources
were reported.

\item \textbf{PoWrWa} (A collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
(Germany), the University of Wroclaw (Poland) and the Polish Academy of
Sciences (Poland)). A sequential ${\cal F}$-statistic match filter search
using rigid-adiabatic templates. Individual bandwidths of $0.1 {\rm mHz}$
were analyzed. The brightest source in each band was identified and
removed, and the process repeated until a pre-set SNR threshold was
reached. A total of 14838 sources were reported.

\end{itemize}

The Challenge 3.1 dataset contains the signals from over 60 million
chirping galactic binaries. The vast majority of these signals are too
weak to be isolated, leaving an unresolved component which forms a
non-stationary confusion noise that adds to the overall noise level.
Estimates based on self-consistent removal schemes~\cite{Timpano:2005gm}
or Bayesian model selection~\cite{Crowder:2007ft} suggest that it should be
possible to recover between 20,000-30,000 galactic sources. The entries
for this round fell short of this target for a variety of reasons.
The \textbf{BhamUIB} entry only analyzed a small fraction of the data,
while the \textbf{AEIRIT} and \textbf{PoWrWa} use sequential removal
schemes, which limits how deep they can dig before source confusion
degrades the signal recovery. Previous studies~\cite{Crowder:2007ft}
indicate that it should be possible to recover approximately 99\% of
the resolvable sources to an accuracy of better than 90\% (as measured
by the overlap between the injected and recovered waveforms). We therefore
adopt the signal correlation as the metric by which the entries are measured.

The first step in computing the correlation between injected and recovered
signals is to identify the injected signal that corresponds most closely
to the recovered signal. This is done by taking all the injected signals
with ${\rm SNR} > 3$ that have frequencies within 6 frequency bins of the
recovered signal and computing the chisquared $\chi^2 = (h-h' \vert h- h')$,
where $h$ is the injected waveform (generated from the key file),
$h'$ is the recovered waveform (generated using the submitted source
parameters), and the brackets $(a\vert b)$ denote the standard noise weighted
inner product summed over the noise orthogonal $A,E,T$ TDI channels.
The injected signal with the smallest $\chi^2$ is identified with the
recovered signal. The correlation between these signals, $C= (h \vert h')/
(h\vert h)^{1/2} (h' \vert h')^{1/2}$, is then computed. Using as our
figure of merit the percentage of recovered sources with $C > 0.9$ we
found: \textbf{BhamUIB} 30\%; \textbf{AEIRIT} 95\%; \textbf{PoWrWa} 33\%.
The \textbf{PoWrWa} group have reported a bug in their analysis
code that affects sources with frequencies above 3 mHz. If we only
consider the 6955 sources they recoverd below 2 mHz, their figure of
merit improves to 58\%.

\section{Massive black-hole binaries (MLDC 3.2)}

Challenge dataset 3.2 contained five signals from MBH inspirals, embedded in instrument noise and a partially subtracted Galactic background (see \cite{MLDC3} for a synopsis of the waveform model and for the random selection of source parameters). Multi-TDI SNRs ranged from $\sim 13$ to $\sim 1671$, with the two weakest signals (MBH-2 and MBH-6) corresponding to mergers after the end of the dataset. Five collaborations submitted entries:
%
% For a spinning MBH binary in a quasi-circular orbit, we have adopted restricted waveforms with the GW phase expanded to 2 post-Newtonian order (see section 3.2 of \cite{MLDC3}). The magnitude and orientation of spins cover all possible values.  Each source is described by fifteen parameters: the two masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, the time of coalescence $t_{c}$, the sky-position angles $\beta$ and $\lambda$, the luminosity distance $D_{L}$, the initial orbital phase $\phi_{0}$, the magnitude of spins $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, the initial orientation of the first spin  $\theta_{S1}$ and $\phi_{S1}$, the orientation of the second spin $\theta_{S2}$ and $\phi_{S2}$ and the initial orientation of the orbital angular momentum  $\theta_{L}$ and $\phi_{L}$. The parameters for all sources are drawn uniformly from the same prior range, but were distinguished by the times of coalescence and the SNR which are given in Table 8 of \cite{MLDC3}.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AEI} (researchers at the Albert Einstein Institute, Germany) used a genetic matched-filtering algorithm extended to a multi-modal search; as a merit function they took the $A$-statistic, a geometrical mean of the log-likelihood for the signal and for a low-frequency signal subset \cite{GAspinbbhFullPaper}.
\item \textbf{CambAEI} (a collaboration between the Cambridge Cavendish Laboratory and Institute of Astronomy with the the Albert Einstein Institute) adopted the MultiNest implementation of nested-sampling integration \cite{MultiNest2} to compute the evidence and produce posterior distributions. This method is intrinsically multimodal, and the $A$-statistic was used to identify modes.
\item \textbf{GSFC} (researchers at Goddard Space Flight Center) employed the Xspec tempered Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm \cite{Xspec}. 
\item \textbf{JPLCITNWU} (a collaboration between JPL/Caltech and Northwestern University) employed a two-stage method whereby they followed up a nonspinning MBH search \cite{JPLCaltech} with MultiNest.
\item \textbf{MTGWAGAPC} (researchers at Montana State University and at the Astro-Particle and Cosmology Institute in Paris) adopted a parallel-tempering MCMC algorithm, evolved from the thermostated, frequency-annealed algorithm employed in previous challenges \cite{SMBHCornishPorter}.
\end{itemize}
%
All five groups recovered parameters for the loud signals; MBH-2 (SNR $\sim$ 19) was recovered by AEI, CambAEI, JPLCITNWU and MTGWAGAPC; MBH-6 (SNR $\sim$ 13) by AEI, CambAEI and MTGWAGAPC. Participants were encouraged to submit multiple modes of comparable probability, if present. For the best (highest-SNR) mode in each entry, Table \ref{tab:SMBH_Err} lists the fractional parameter errors, as well as the recovered SNR and individual TDI-channel fitting factor FF. Both the recovered SNR and the $\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{true}$ of the true waveform were computed by filtering the noisy dataset (in its LISA Simulator version) with the appropriate template, while the FFs were computed between noiseless signals. Note that the reported modes had often SNR differences of less than one, and the highest-SNR mode did not always have the best parameter recovery.

\begin{table}
\caption{Selected parameter errors, SNRs, and FFs for each group's highest-SNR entries to MLDC 3.2. The time of coalescence $t_c$, spin magnitudes $a_{1,2}$ and luminosity distance $D$ are defined in Table 7 of \cite{MLDC3}; in addition, the (redshifted) chirp mass $M_c \equiv (m_1 m_2)^{3/5} / (m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}$, and the symmetric mass ratio $\eta = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)^{2}$. $\Delta\textrm{sky}$ is the angular geodesic distance between 
the estimated and true positions; values $\sim 180$ deg correspond to the antipodal sky location, a known quasi-degeneracy in the LISA response.\label{tab:SMBH_Err}} \vspace{-12pt}

The binaries that merge within the duration of the dataset (MBH-1, 3, and 4) have significantly larger SNR and reach higher frequencies, and thus allow a much more accurate recovery of source parameters. For these sources, the mass, time-of-coalescence, distance, and sky-position errors are comparable, if not better, to those of nonspinning-binary searches (see Tables 1 and 2 of \cite{mldcamaldi2}). The errors in the spin amplitudes are consistent with the Fisher-matrix results of \cite{SpinBBHLangHughes}.
However, despite the high SNR, the estimation of the initial direction of the spins and of the orbital angular momentum has proved to be very difficult. We observe a large number of the local likelihood maxima that have comparable, high SNR (and $\mathrm{FF} > 0.99$), yet very different values of these parameters, as illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:SMBH_spinLdeg} for the MBH-3 entries. Parameter estimation was not as successful for the weaker signals with mergers beyond the end of the dataset. Still, for MBH-2 the errors in the masses and time of coalescence are comparable to the Fisher matrix predictions. The errors in sky position are $\sim 10$ deg, with a strong local likelihood maxima at the antipodal sky position. Spin amplitudes are determined very poorly.
% ISSUE: The recovered SNR for some modes was higher than the true one which is an artifact of the evaluation: we extend the computation of the inner products beyond the frequency range of the signals which picks up a bit of the ``junk'' SNR from the correlation with the noise. [This means that the templates are not truncated at the end of the dataset?]
% ISSUE: The determination of the spin amplitude is very bad. This reflects the fact that the spins have a very weak effect on the low frequency part of the waveform. [Removing pending resolution of issue raised by Alberto.]

Lang and Hughes \cite{SpinBBHLangHughes} report that spin-induced modulations remove correlations between parameters in Fisher-matrix computations, improving overall parameter determination. However, here we observe that spin interactions also cause nonlocal degeneracies in parameters space, especially so for spin and orbital--angular-momentum angles. Further investigations are needed to determine which phenomenon is stronger. Nevertheless, the entries to MLDC 3.2 demonstrate a solid detection capability for spinning-binary inspirals, and a good recovery of most source parameters.

\section{Extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (MLDC 3.3)}

The Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) signals in Challenge 3.3 are based on Barack \& Cutler analytical kludge waveforms \cite{barackcutler}, as described in \cite{mldcgwdaw2}, but with only five harmonics present per signal \cite{MLDC3}.  Five EMRI signals were injected into a single realization of the LISA detector noise, all coalescing during the second year of the dataset, with dimensionless spins between $0.5$ and $0.7$, eccentricities at plunge between $0.15$ and $0.25$, and smaller-body masses between $9.5 M_\odot$ and $10.5 M_\odot$.  The mass of the larger body was in the range $0.95$--$1.05\times10^7 M_\odot$ for source 3.3.1,  $4.75$--$5.25 \times10^6 M_\odot$ for sources 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and $0.95$--$1.05\times10^6 M_\odot$ for sources 3.3.4 and 3.3.5 (see Table 8 of \cite{MLDC3}).  In addition to the presence of multiple sources in the same data stream, the challenge participants had to contend with much weaker signals than in previous EMRI challenges, with announced signal-to-noise ratios varying between $10$ and $50$ (actual blind-injection SNRs varied between $20$ and $37$).

Three groups attempted to find the Challenge 3.3 sources.  These were:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{BabakGair}: This collaboration between AEI and Cambridge University used stochastic sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to find signal harmonics, and then carried out an F-statistic search in the space of harmonics before applying MCMC in the physical parameter space for the final fit.  The basic methodology is described in \cite{BabakGairPorter}, but this search contained several improvements in harmonic identification.
\item \textbf{EtfAG}: This collaboration between Cambridge University and Northwestern University searched the time-frequency spectrogram for harmonics using the Chirp-based Algorithm for Track Search (CATS, \cite{CATS}) which they developed for earlier MLDC rounds \cite{GairMandelWen}; this iteration included several improvements to the search technique to allow for intersecting tracks from multiple sources.
\item \textbf{MTAPCIOA} This collaboration between Montana State University, APC-Paris, and Cambridge University employed a parallel-tempering MCMC algorithm that included harmonic jumps to force the algorithm to move between secondary solutions in the parameter space. This algorithm was developed from a code used in previous rounds of the MLDC \cite{Cornish:2008}; the key improvements for this round were the inclusion of parallel-tempering as described in \cite{keycornish} and improved implementation of the harmonic jumps.
\end{itemize}

The MLDC 3.3 parameter-estimation results are presented in Table \ref{tab:EMRI_Err}.  The columns include the mass of the large body $M$, the mass of the small body $\mu$, the initial value of the azimuthal orbital frequency $\nu_0$, the initial value of the eccentricity $e_0$, the dimensionless spin $|S|$, the spin-orbit misalignment angle $\lambda$ and the luminosity distance to the source $D$.  The angular distances in the sky between true and estimated spin orientations $\Delta {\rm Spin}$ and source locations $\Delta {\rm Sky}$ are also included.

All five EMRI signals were recovered with nearby parameters by MTAPCIOA.  This group was generally able to get very good parameter-estimation accuracies, with fractional errors of a few tenths of a percent in the masses of both bodies and sky localization errors of a few degrees (up to $13$ degrees for EMRI-4).  One of their solutions for EMRI-1 was particularly impressive, with fractional errors of a few times $10^{-5}$ in masses, initial eccentricity, and initial spin.  However, an indication of the difficulty of resolving secondary maxima is shown by this group's other solution for EMRI-1, which has almost the same SNR ($21.794$ for the secondary vs.~$21.804$ for the primary), but parameter errors that are about two orders of magnitude greater.  

The time-frequency analysis carried out by the EtfAG group was particularly hard-hit by the simultaneous lowering of the SNR and the presence of multiple overlapping signals in MLDC 3.3.  The group was unable to find the low-frequency, low-SNR source EMRI-1.  And while they found a medium-frequency source, the relatively large parameter-estimation errors suggest that the time-frequency approach did not adequately resolve between the overlapping harmonics of the sources EMRI-2 and EMRI-3.

The BabakGair group submitted three (relatively close) solutions for each of EMRI-2 and EMRI-3.  For EMRI-3, their estimates are better than those of EtfAG and comparable to those of MTAPCIOA, albeit somewhat less accurate for the initial parameter values and distance.  For EMRI-2, BabakGair had errors of a few percent in the masses and initial eccentricity, and had significant errors in the spin orientation angle and distance, although the location of the source on the sky was still found correctly to within $3.5$ degrees.

The high-frequency sources EMRI-4 and EMRI-5 presented a challenge for all groups.  Although MTAPCIOA found these sources and estimated their masses fairly accurately, they had significantly higher errors in determining the magnitude and orientation of the spins than for other sources, and they overestimated the distance to both sources by factors of $2$ or $3$ vs.~distance errors of $\lesssim 10\%$ for the other EMRI sources.  Furthermore, their negative SNR for the claimed EMRI-4 source and the low overlaps between the individual recovered and injected waveforms for EMRI-4 and EMRI-5, indicate that, in fact, these sources were not resolved individually; rather, the MTAPCIOA search converged on two parameter sets which jointly represent a combination of the two injected sources.   The other two groups were unable to localize either of the high-frequency EMRI sources by the submission deadline.

Thus, while all EMRI sources have been found and their masses have been accurately estimated, the results of MLDC 3.3 suggest that some work remains to be done on improving the estimates of EMRI parameters for relatively weak and overlapping signals.


\section{Cosmic-string--cusp bursts (MLDC 3.4)}

% Each source is described by a set of 6 parameters: the ecliptic latitude $\beta$ and longitude $\lambda$, the amplitude of the wave ${\mathcal A}$, the polarization of the wave $\psi$, the burst's central time of arrival $t_C$ and a frequency parameter $f_\mathrm{max}$.
% The groups were informed that the signal to noise ratio was uniform between 10 and 100, the logarithm of ($f_{max}/$Hz) was uniformly distributed between $[-3,1]$ and the event rate was Poisson distributed with 5 events per month.  Four groups returned entries for Challenge 3.4.

Challenge dataset 3.4 contained three burst signals from cosmic-string cusps, immersed in instrument noise with slightly randomized levels for each individual noise (i.e., from the six proof masses and photodetectors). The dataset was less than a month long ($2^{21}$ s), with a higher sampling rate (1 s) than the others, to accommodate the potential high-frequency content of these signals, which have power-law spectrum up to an $f_\mathrm{max}$ determined by the characteristic length scale of the string and the viewing angle (see \cite{MLDC3} for more details about the waveforms and the random choice of their parameters). Four collaborations submitted entries:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CAM} (a collaboration between Cambridge University and APC--Paris) used MultiNest.
\item \textbf{CaNoe} (researchers at Cambridge and Northwestern Universities) implemented a time--frequency algorithm, a modified version of the Chirp-based Algorithm for Track Searches (CATS) \cite{CATS}.
\item \textbf{JPLCIT} (Caltech/JPL) experimented with MCMC and MultiNest, but only submitted entries based on the latter.
\item \textbf{MTGWAG} (Montana State University) used a parallel-tempering MCMC \cite{keycornish}. 
\end{itemize}
%
All groups successfully recovered all three bursts. Table \ref{tab:parerrs} shows the parameter-estimation errors, SNRs, and FFs for all entries. 
Although the accuracy of parameters is poor, the FFs are very high; this suggests that these results are not due to shortcomings in the search methods, but to the very character of the waveforms. As a matter of fact, for relatively short signals such as these bursts, LISA can be considered as a static detector, and its response is not imprinted with any modulations from the LISA orbit or from the rotation of its constellation. Hence the sky position of burst sources can only be determined by triangulation between the spacecraft---a weaker effect, and one that vanishes in the limit of long wavelengths. Thus, the determination of sky position is intrinsically harder for bursts, and it is further complicated by the presence of degeneracies \cite{keycornish} such as the reflection of sky position across the instantaneous LISA plane. The bursts' barycentric central time $t_C$ and its polarization are strongly coupled with sky position, and therefore are also determined poorly.

\section{Stochastic background (MLDC 3.5)}

Challenge dataset 3.5 contained an isotropic stochastic background signal immersed in instrument noise, with noise levels slightly randomized as in MLDC 3.4.
To facilitate the use of the GW-canceling TDI combination $T$, 
the LISA orbits were approximated as those traced by a rigidly rotating
triangle, with equal and constant arm lengths (except for the Sagnac effect). The background was realized by placing $192 \times 2$ linearly polarized, stochastic pseudosources at positions uniformly distributed across the sky. See \cite{MLDC3} for more details. Now, isotropic stochastic backgrounds can be characterized by a single dimensionless quantity,
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)=\frac{1}{\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}}\frac{\mathrm{d} \rho_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)}{\mathrm{d} \log{f}},
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)$ is the energy density in GWs,
and $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}=3c^2H_0^2/8\pi G$ is the energy density required
to close the Universe. In this MLDC round, $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$ was taken to be constant across frequencies, and in this dataset it was set equal to $1.123 \times 10^{-11}$ (with $H_0=70 \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Mpc}$). Two groups submitted entries for this challenge, and both analyzed the same version of the dataset, generated by Synthetic LISA:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AEIBham} (a collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
and the University of Birmingham) submitted multiple entries using different applications of the same MCMC algorithm. In this paper we focus on the AEIBham analysis of the TDI $A$ and $E$ observables, which was run separately over frequency bands of 0.1--1 mHz (a) and 0.1--5 mHz (b).
\item \textbf{MTGWAG} (Montana State University) analyzed the TDI $A$, $E$, and $T$ spectra with parallel-tempering MCMC. They estimated the background level as well as the levels of select linear combinations of the individual LISA noises (other combinations are left essentially undetermined by TDI observations).
\end{itemize}
%
Figure \ref{fig:stochastic_pdf} shows the reported posterior PDFs and the best-fit values for $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$, along with their fractional error; both groups recovered the injected value within less than $10\%$. Figure \ref{fig:stochastic_pdf} shows also the best-fit levels reported by MTGWAG for the determinable proof-mass and photodetector noise combinations.
The AEIBham analyses used theoretical expressions for TDI $A$ and $E$ noise spectra, which left only their overall levels as unknowns. However, this treatment assumed that the secondary noises were symmetrical, which was not the case in this dataset. In addition, because of limitations in the MLDC stochastic-background generation code, the actual GW strain spectrum differed from the nominal $f^{-3}$ power law at higher frequencies.
This may explain why the AEIBham (b) result was further from the injected
value that either the AEIBham (a) result (in which band the GW spectrum was actually $f^{-3}$) or the MTGWAG result, which used all three TDI channel, solved for their unknown correlations, and calibrated the GW spectrum using training datasets.

\section{Moving forward: a synopsis of MLDC 4}
\label{sec:mldc4}

While the third round of the MLDCs was focused on increasing the complexity and variety of GW sources, we are devoting the next iteration to the \emph{global-fit} problem of detecting and analyzing sources of different types superposed in the LISA data. Thus, MDLC 4 consists of a single, ``whole enchilada'' challenge (MLDC 4) that includes all the sources of MLDCs 3.1--3.5 \emph{in the same dataset}, albeit with larger source numbers (for EMRIs and cosmic-string bursts) and parameter ranges (for MBH binaries and EMRIs). See Table \ref{table:MLDC4} for details. The duration of the dataset is again approximately two years ($2^{22} \times 15$ s), but the data are released both as a high-cadence time series of $2^{25}$ samples with $\Delta t = 1.875$ s, and as a downsampled time series of $2^{22}$ samples with $\Delta t = 15$ s (however, only the cosmic-string bursts and instrument noise contribute spectral content above 33 mHz).

Three versions of both datasets are released: fractional-frequency fluctuation data generated by Synthetic LISA \cite{synthlisa} and LISACode \cite{lisacode}, and equivalent strain data generated by the LISA Simulator \cite{lisasimulator}. In contrast to MLDCs 3.4 and 3.5, all the LISA instrument noises are set to symmetric, nominal levels, and the LISA armlength are allowed to ``breathe.'' See \cite{mldcgwdaw2,MLDC3} for more details about the MLDC models of LISA orbits, noises, and interferometric observables. The waveform models of MLDC 3 \cite{MLDC3} are used unchanged in MLDC 4, except for the following changes: when MBH binaries end within the duration of the dataset, they are terminated with a taper XXX; the spectra of cosmic-string bursts are truncated below $10^{-5}$ Hz; the stochastic-background spectrum is $f^{-3}$ between $10^{-5}$ Hz and 33 mHz, and drops lower below and above that range.

Challenges beyond MLDC 4 will feature ever more realistic datasets, including more sophisticated waveform models, such as MBH coalescences with merger and ringdown phases, and ``real-mission'' noise models and instrument events drawn from the ongoing experimental investigations of the LISA architecture and subsystem. To obtain more information and to participate in the MLDCs, see the official MLDC website, \url{astrogravs.nasa.gov/docs/mldc}, and the Task Force wiki, \url{www.tapir.caltech.edu/listwg1b}.
