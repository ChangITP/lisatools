\begin{abstract}
The Mock LISA Data Challenges are a program to demonstrate LISA data-analysis capabilities and to encourage their development. Each round of challenges consists of one or more containing simulated instrument noise and gravitational waves from sources of undisclosed parameters. Participants analyze the datasets and report best-fit solutions for the source parameters. Here we present the results of the third challenge, issued in Apr 2008, which demonstrated the positive recovery of signals from chirping Galactic binaries, from spinning supermassive--black-hole binaries (with optimal SNRs between $\sim 10$ and $2000$), from simultaneous extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (SNR of 10--50), from cosmic-string cusps (bursts of SNR 10--100), and from a relatively loud isotropic background ($\Omega_\mathrm{gw} \sim 10^{-11}$, slightly below the LISA instrument noise.

\section{The Mock LISA Data Challenges}

The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned NASA--ESA gravitational-wave (GW) observatory sensitive in the $10^{-5}$--$10^{-1}$ Hz range \cite{lisa}. LISA's data will contain superposed signals from millions of sources, including all the binaries in the Galaxies with orbital periods below 10 hours, and massive--black-hole (MBH) binary coalescences out to $z \sim 20$. Thousands of sources will be resolvable individually. The potential for source confusion, as well as the very complex dynamics and waveforms of sources such as extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), suggested the need for a coordinated effort to develop and demonstrate LISA data-analysis capabilities. The Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDCs) began in early 2006 with this very purpose.

The complexity and ambition of the challenges has risen with each round: MLDC 1 \cite{mldclisasymp,mldcgwdaw1} focused on simple sources, isolated or moderately interfering; MLDC 2 \cite{mldcgwdaw2,mldcamaldi2} introduced a Galactic \emph{ensemble} of 26 million binaries (20,000 of which were successfully recovered), as well as the problem of detecting MBH binaries over the Galactic cacophony; MLDC 1B \cite{MLDC3} reprised the first challenge for new research collaborations joining the effort, and saw the first successful detections of EMRI signals. MLDC 3, released in April 2008 and due in April 2009, consisted of five subchallenges that featured more realistic models of previously examined sources (chirping Galactic binaries in MLDC 3.1, spinning MBH binary inspirals in 3.2, superposed EMRIs in 3.3) and entirely new sources (GW bursts from cosmic-string cusps in 3.4, an isotropic stochastic background in 3.5); see \cite{MLDC3} for a detailed discussion. Fifteen collaborations, comprising all the participants listed in the byline, and most task-force members, submitted a total of seventeen entries (all can be found at \url{www.tapir.caltech.edu/~mldc/results3} together with technical notes about search implementation).

In this paper we briefly report on the detection and parameter-estimation performance demonstrated in each entry. Altogether, MLDC 3 showed substantial progress in tackling increasingly difficult data-analysis problems, and introduced new search methods such as nested sampling and sophisticated genetic optimization--Markov Chain hybrids. However, there is certainly room for improvement and further work: fewer Galactic binaries were recovered by the iterative searches employed here than by the multi-source MCMC demonstrated in MLDC 2; MBH binaries and EMRIs were detected with high confidence, but the accurate estimation of their parameters (beyond the dominant ones) was stymied by the complex global structure and the many local maxima of likelihood surfaces. On the bright side, searches for cosmic-string bursts and stochastic backgrounds (admittedly simple problems in the absence of nonstationary or non-Gaussian instrument noise) met no roadblocks.
Section \ref{sec:mldc4} introduces MLDC 4, which is being released as we write (November 2009), with entries due at the end of 2010.

\section{Galactic Binaries (MLDC 3.1)}

Three groups submitted Galactic Binary catalogs:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{BhamUIB} (A collaboration between the University of
Birmingham (UK) and the University of the Balearic Islands (Spain))
A multi-source MCMC algorithm was used to search in three narrow
frequency windows, $0.3 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 0.4 {\rm mHz}$,
$0.9 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 1.0 {\rm mHz}$, and
$1.6 {\rm mHz} \leq f \leq 1.7 {\rm mHz}$. The MLDC waveform
generator was used. A total of 494 sources were reported.

\item \textbf{AEIRIT} (A collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
(Germany) and the Rochester Institute of Technology (US)). A LIGO-style
hierachical, sequential, ${\cal F}$-statistic match filter search
using frequency domain, rigid-adiabatic templates.
Individual TDI channels are used to generate triggers, and those that
pass a concidence condition are passed to a final, coherent analysis
using noise-orthogonal TDI combinations. A total of 1940 sources
were reported.

\item \textbf{PoWrWa} (A collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
(Germany), the University of Wroclaw (Poland) and the Polish Academy of
Sciences (Poland)). A sequential ${\cal F}$-statistic match filter search
using rigid-adiabatic templates. Individual bandwidths of $0.1 {\rm mHz}$
were analyzed. The brightest source in each band was identified and
removed, and the process repeated until a pre-set SNR threshold was
reached. A total of 14838 sources were reported.

\end{itemize}

The Challenge 3.1 dataset contains the signals from over 60 million
chirping galactic binaries. The vast majority of these signals are too
weak to be isolated, leaving an unresolved component which forms a
non-stationary confusion noise that adds to the overall noise level.
Estimates based on self-consistent removal schemes~\cite{Timpano:2005gm}
or Bayesian model selection~\cite{Crowder:2007ft} suggest that it should be
possible to recover between 20,000-30,000 galactic sources. The entries
for this round fell short of this target for a variety of reasons.
The \textbf{BhamUIB} entry only analyzed a small fraction of the data,
while the \textbf{AEIRIT} and \textbf{PoWrWa} use sequential removal
schemes, which limits how deep they can dig before source confusion
degrades the signal recovery. Previous studies~\cite{Crowder:2007ft}
indicate that it should be possible to recover approximately 99\% of
the resolvable sources to an accuracy of better than 90\% (as measured
by the overlap between the injected and recovered waveforms). We therefore
adopt the signal correlation as the metric by which the entries are measured.

The first step in computing the correlation between injected and recovered
signals is to identify the injected signal that corresponds most closely
to the recovered signal. This is done by taking all the injected signals
with ${\rm SNR} > 3$ that have frequencies within 6 frequency bins of the
recovered signal and computing the chisquared $\chi^2 = (h-h' \vert h- h')$,
where $h$ is the injected waveform (generated from the key file),
$h'$ is the recovered waveform (generated using the submitted source
parameters), and the brackets $(a\vert b)$ denote the standard noise weighted
inner product summed over the noise orthogonal $A,E,T$ TDI channels.
The injected signal with the smallest $\chi^2$ is identified with the
recovered signal. The correlation between these signals, $C= (h \vert h')/
(h\vert h)^{1/2} (h' \vert h')^{1/2}$, is then computed. Using as our
figure of merit the percentage of recovered sources with $C > 0.9$ we
found: \textbf{BhamUIB} 30\%; \textbf{AEIRIT} 95\%; \textbf{PoWrWa} 33\%.
The \textbf{PoWrWa} group have reported a bug in their analysis
code that affects sources with frequencies above 3 mHz. If we only
consider the 6955 sources they recoverd below 2 mHz, their figure of
merit improves to 58\%.

\section{Massive black-hole binaries (MLDC 3.2)}

The dataset 3.2 contained four to six signals from inspiralling spinning Massive Black Hole (MBH) binaries embedded in both instrument noise and a galactic background. The galactic background was modeled as simulated 
galactic GW data with signals below  a signal-to-noise ratio  of 6. 
For a spinning MBH binary in a quasi-circular orbit, we have adopted restricted waveforms with 
the GW phase expanded to 2 post-Newtonian order (see section 3.2 of \cite{MLDC3}). The magnitude and orientation of spins cover all possible values.  Each source is described by fifteen parameters: the two masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, the time of coalescence $t_{c}$, the sky-position angles $\beta$ and $\lambda$, the luminosity distance $D_{L}$, the initial orbital phase $\phi_{0}$, the magnitude of spins $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, the initial orientation of the first spin  $\theta_{S1}$ and $\phi_{S1}$, the orientation of the second spin $\theta_{S2}$ and $\phi_{S2}$ and the initial orientation of the orbital angular momentum  $\theta_{L}$ and $\phi_{L}$. The parameters for all sources are drawn uniformly from the 
same prior range, but were distinguished by the times of coalescence and the SNR which are given in Table 8 of \cite{MLDC3}.

The participants were allowed to submit multiple modes for each source, provided that there was no clear way of preferring one mode to another. In other words, the solutions should reflect the degeneracies in the parameter space and multi-modality of the
likelihood. Five groups submitted their results: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AEI} (Albert Einstein Institute (Germany))  have used a matched-filtering based genetic algorithm extended to a multi-modal search. The maximized function is the {\em A-statistic} which is a geometrical mean of the log-likelihood for the whole duration template and the low-frequency template \cite{GAspinbbhFullPaper}.

\item \textbf{CambAEI} (collaboration between Cavendish Laboratory (UK), the Institute of Astronomy (UK) and the Albert Einstein Institute, (Germany)) have employed the MultiNest algorithm \cite{MultiNest2} to compute the 
evidence and to produce posterior distributions. The method is intrinsically multi-modal as it name states. They have 
also used the {\em A-statistic} to identify modes.

\item \textbf{GSFC} (Goddard Space Fly Center (US)) used a tempered Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm within the framework of Xspec \cite{Xspec}. 

\item \textbf{JPLCITNWU} (a collaboration between  CalTech (US),  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (US)  
and Northwestern University (US)) have employed a two-stage method. At first, they searched for the bright sources using the tools developed for a non-spinning MBH search \cite{JPLCaltech}, and in the second stage, they employed  the MultiNest algorithm.

\item \textbf{MTGWAGAPC} (a collaboration between Montana Gravitational Wave Astronomy Group (US) and  
the Astro-Particle and Cosmology Institute (France)) have used a parallel tempering MCMC algorithm. It is based on the MHMC algorithm used in previous challenges which utilizes frequency and thermostated annealing for an efficient parameter space exploration \cite{SMBHCornishPorter}. Parallel tempering employs a number of chains
 at different temperatures where the hot chains explore the parameter space throughout the whole range, while the cool chains concentrate on the local maxima and the chains exchange information with each other via a genetic algorithm.

\end{itemize}

There were five signals from MBH binaries in this dataset. The parameters for the first three binaries which coalesce within the observation (MBH-1, 3 and 4) were recovered by all five groups. For the last two low SNR signals, MBH-2 (SNR $\sim$ 19), parameters were recovered by AEI, CambAEI, MTGWAGAPC and JPLCITNWU, whereas for MBH-6 (SNR $\sim$ 13), parameters were recovered by AEI, CambAEI and MTGWAGAPC.  

Table \ref{tab:SMBH_Err} shows fractional errors in the parameter estimations for the five sources. We have chosen only the best mode from each submission (i.e. highest SNR) for comparison with the true solution. Note that 
sometimes the difference in the SNR of several modes was less that 1, and the mode with the better 
parameter recovery was not chosen.
Table \ref{tab:SMBH_SNR} shows the recovered SNR and the overlap with  the true waveform for TDI channels A and E. We should note that the SNR is calculated by comparing the recovered waveforms with the full dataset, whereas the overlap evaluations were conducted by using waveforms with the true and recovered parameters and the software
used to produce the MLDC.

\begin{table}
\caption{ Relative/absolute errors for the spinning MBH binaries in Challenge~3.2. All parameters are defined as in the table 7 of \cite{MLDC3}, except for the chirp mass $M_c \equiv (m_1 m_2)^{3/5} / (m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}$ and for the symmetric mass ratio $\eta = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2)^{2}$.  $ \Delta \textmd{Sky}$ is the angular distance in the sky between 
the true and the estimated positions. We used only the mode with the highest SNR in all tables, if several modes per group were submitted. Recovered SNR and overlaps for spinning MBH binaries in Challenge~3.2. The negative

The accuracy in the parameter estimation strongly depends on whether we have observed the coalescence or not.
The signals with observed merger (MBH-1, 3 and 4) have significantly larger SNR and span to higher frequencies, 
allowing much more accurate recovery of the parameters of the MBH binary. 
 For these sources, the errors in the masses, the time at coalescence, the distance and the sky position are comparable, if not better, to the ones obtained in non-spinning case (see table 1 and 2 of report on challenge 2.2 \cite{mldcamaldi2}). Concerning the position on the sky, the results with  $\Delta \textrm{Sky} > 170 \deg$, correspond to the mirrored sky location which is a known degeneracy in the response function. The errors in the spin amplitudes
  are consistent with the Fisher matrix prediction \cite{SpinBBHLangHugues}.  Despite the high SNR, the evaluation of the initial direction of the spins and of the orbital angular momentum has proven to be very difficult.  We observe a large number of the local maxima in these parameters which have SNR very close to the true one. This is illustrated in the Figure~\ref{fig:SMBH_spinLdeg} which shows the distribution of $\theta_{S1}$, $\phi_{S1}$, $\theta_{S2}$, $\phi_{S2}$, $\theta_{L}$ and $\phi_{L}$ for all the submitted modes for MBH-3. We see that the modes are well separated in parameter values, but the difference in the SNR is less than 10. The SNR of the majority of submitted results are within 10 of the true one and the overlap is higher than 0.99.
This reflects the degeneracies in the parameter space and that the recovered signals resemble the true one very closely, despite poor estimation of some parameters.

The color corresponds to the SNR.

\end{figure}


Let us now comment on the parameter estimation for the last two signals with the coalescence time beyond the observational time. For MBH-2 the error in the masses and the time of coalescence are comparable to the Fisher matrix predictions. 
The errors in the sky localization are around 10 degrees with a very strong local maximum at the mirrored 
sky position. The overlaps between the recovered waveforms and the true ones are higher than 0.9 for all submissions.
The recovered SNR for some modes was higher than the true one which is an artifact of the evaluation: 
we extend the computation of the inner products beyond the frequency range of the signals which picks up a bit of the 
``junk'' SNR from the correlation with the noise. 
%
The determination of the spin amplitude is very bad. This reflects the fact that the spins have a very weak effect on the low frequency part of the waveform. 

The source MBH-6 was the weakest, and tree groups succeeded in recovering parameters. 

The spins are supposed to de-correlate some parameters in the waveform \cite{SpinBBHLangHugues} and we 
might observe this in some cases, but more investigations are needed to clearly conclude his point.
However, the spins also bring additional degeneracies and multiple local maxima in the parameter space, especially in the initial directions of the spins and the orbital plane. This complexity is reflected in the submitted results.
Nevertheless these results demonstrate solid capability in detecting the signals and good recovery of other 
nine parameters. 

\section{Extreme--mass-ratio inspirals (MLDC 3.3)}

The Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) signals in Challenge 3.3 are based on Barack \& Cutler analytical kludge waveforms \cite{barackcutler}, as described in \cite{mldcgwdaw2}, but with only five harmonics present per signal \cite{MLDC3}.  Five EMRI signals were injected into a single realization of the LISA detector noise, all coalescing during the second year of the dataset, with dimensionless spins between $0.5$ and $0.7$, eccentricities at plunge between $0.15$ and $0.25$, and smaller-body masses between $9.5 M_\odot$ and $10.5 M_\odot$.  The mass of the larger body was in the range $0.95$--$1.05\times10^7 M_\odot$ for source 3.3.1,  $4.75$--$5.25 \times10^6 M_\odot$ for sources 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and $0.95$--$1.05\times10^6 M_\odot$ for sources 3.3.4 and 3.3.5 (see Table 8 of \cite{MLDC3}).  In addition to the presence of multiple sources in the same data stream, the challenge participants had to contend with much weaker signals than in previous EMRI challenges, with announced signal-to-noise ratios varying between $10$ and $50$ (actual blind-injection SNRs varied between $20$ and $37$).

Three groups attempted to find the Challenge 3.3 sources.  These were:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{BabakGair}: This collaboration between AEI and Cambridge University used stochastic sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to find signal harmonics, and then carried out an F-statistic search in the space of harmonics before applying MCMC in the physical parameter space for the final fit.  The basic methodology is described in \cite{BabakGairPorter}, but this search contained several improvements in harmonic identification.
\item \textbf{EtfAG}: This collaboration between Cambridge University and Northwestern University searched the time-frequency spectrogram for harmonics using the Chirp-based Algorithm for Track Search (CATS, \cite{CATS}) which they developed for earlier MLDC rounds \cite{GairMandelWen}; this iteration included several improvements to the search technique to allow for intersecting tracks from multiple sources.
\item \textbf{MTAPCIOA} This collaboration between Montana State University, APC-Paris, and Cambridge University employed a parallel tempering MCMC algorithm that included harmonic jumps to force the algorithm to move between secondary solutions in the parameter space. This algorithm was developed from a code used in previous rounds of the MLDC \cite{Cornish:2008}; the key improvements for this round were the inclusion of parallel tempering as described in \cite{keycornish} and improved implementation of the harmonic jumps.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

The MLDC 3.3 parameter-estimation results are presented in Table \ref{tab:EMRI_Err}.  The columns include the mass of the large body $M$, the mass of the small body $\mu$, the initial value of the azimuthal orbital frequency $\nu_0$, the initial value of the eccentricity $e_0$, the dimensionless spin $|S|$, the spin-orbit misalignment angle $\lambda$ and the luminosity distance to the source $D$.  The angular distances in the sky between true and estimated spin orientations $\Delta {\rm Spin}$ and source locations $\Delta {\rm Sky}$ are also included.

All five EMRI signals were recovered with nearby parameters by MTAPCIOA.  This group was generally able to get very good parameter-estimation accuracies, with fractional errors of a few tenths of a percent in the masses of both bodies and sky localization errors of a few degrees (up to $13$ degrees for EMRI-4).  One of their solutions for EMRI-1 was particularly impressive, with fractional errors of a few times $10^{-5}$ in masses, initial eccentricity, and initial spin.  However, an indication of the difficulty of resolving secondary maxima is shown by this group's other solution for EMRI-1, which has almost the same SNR ($21.794$ for the secondary vs.~$21.804$ for the primary), but parameter errors that are about two orders of magnitude greater.  

The time-frequency analysis carried out by the EtfAG group was particularly hard-hit by the simultaneous lowering of the SNR and the presence of multiple overlapping signals in MLDC 3.3.  The group was unable to find the low-frequency, low-SNR source EMRI-1.  And while they found a medium-frequency source, the relatively large parameter-estimation errors suggest that the time-frequency approach did not adequately resolve between the overlapping harmonics of the sources EMRI-2 and EMRI-3.

The BabakGair group submitted three (relatively close) solutions for each of EMRI-2 and EMRI-3.  For EMRI-3, their estimates are better than those of EtfAG and comparable to those of MTAPCIOA, albeit somewhat less accurate for the initial parameter values and distance.  For EMRI-2, BabakGair had errors of a few percent in the masses and initial eccentricity, and had significant errors in the spin orientation angle and distance, although the location of the source on the sky was still found correctly to within $3.5$ degrees.

The high-frequency sources EMRI-4 and EMRI-5 presented a challenge for all groups.  Although MTAPCIOA found these sources and estimated their masses fairly accurately, they had significantly higher errors in determining the magnitude and orientation of the spins than for other sources, and they overestimated the distance to both sources by factors of $2$ or $3$ vs.~distance errors of $\lesssim 10\%$ for the other EMRI sources.  Furthermore, their negative SNR for the claimed EMRI-4 source and the low overlaps between the individual recovered and injected waveforms for EMRI-4 and EMRI-5, indicate that, in fact, these sources were not resolved individually; rather, the MTAPCIOA search converged on two parameter sets which jointly represent a combination of the two injected sources.   The other two groups were unable to localize either of the high-frequency EMRI sources by the submission deadline.

Thus, while all EMRI sources have been found and their masses have been accurately estimated, the results of MLDC 3.3 suggest that some work remains to be done on improving the estimates of EMRI parameters for relatively weak and overlapping signals.


\section{Cosmic-string--cusp bursts (MLDC 3.4)}

A new source for Challenge 3 is the gravitational radiation emitted from the cusps of cosmic superstrings.  The blind data was composed of a one month dataset (i.e. $2^{21}$ samples at 1 second cadence) and contained 3 such sources.  Each source is described
by a set of 6 parameters : the ecliptic latitude $\beta$ and longitude $\lambda$, the amplitude of the wave ${\mathcal A}$, the polarization of the wave $\psi$, the burst's
central time of arrival $t_C$ and a frequency parameter $f_{max}$.  This is the frequency beyond which there is a significant decay in the power spectrum of the burst, and is related to both the characteristic lengthscale of the string and the viewing angle.

The groups were informed that the signal to noise ratio was uniform between 10 and 100, the logarithm of ($f_{max}/$Hz) was uniformly distributed between $[-3,1]$ and the event rate was Poisson distributed with 5 events per month.  Four groups returned entries for Challenge 3.4 .  These were
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CAM} :  A collaboration between Cambridge University and APC-Paris using the MultiNest algorithm. This is an efficient multi-modal
Nested Sampling search algorithm which uses a number of live points in the parameter space.  
\item \textbf{CaNoe} : A collaboration between Cambridge University and Northwestern University using a Time-Frequency search algorithm. This algorithm is a modified
version of the Chirp-based Algorithm for Track Searches which identifies tracks of a particular shape in the spectrogram.
\item \textbf{JPLCIT} : A JPL-Caltech collaboration which used both Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MultiNest algorithms.  The results presented here are for 
the MultiNest search only.
\item \textbf{MTGWAG} : The GW group at Montana State University used a parallel tempered MCMC technique~\cite{keycornish}.  The MCMC is a stochastic search method which is particularly
useful for searches conducted in high dimensional spaces.  The parallel tempering adds the complexity of a number of inter-communicating search
chains at different temperatures.
\end{itemize}

The four groups were successful in recovering all three burst sources.  In Table~\ref{tab:parerrs} we present the errors in parameter estimation for each group.  As each burst is of relatively short duration, LISA can be taken as being an effectively static detector.  Because of this, the position of the source in the sky is harder to determine than for other sources.  It has also been shown~\cite{keycornish} that for cosmic string bursts there are a number of degeneracies in the parameter space.  For example, a reflection in the plane of the detector produces one set of degenerate parameters, while a rotation in the plane generates two sets of secondary maxima.  This coupled with the fact that there is a high correlation between the sky position of the source and the central burst time makes parameter estimation very difficult.  

We can see in most cases that the errors for the ecliptic latitude $\beta$ are between 0.1 and 1 radians, while the errors in the estimation of the longitude are much bigger.  This inaccuracy in the sky position also makes it difficult to determine the polarization of the wave.  In certain cases, the errors in sky resolution translates to a large error in the estimation in the central burst time $t_C$.   Similarly, groups had trouble determining the value of $f_{max}$ and in some cases returned the value of the Nyquist frequency in their search (i.e. 0.5 Hz) which resulted in the occasionally very large errors in the estimation of this parameter. Finally, in most cases the groups were able to resolve the amplitude of the waves.

\section{Stochastic background (MLDC 3.5)}

This is the first round of the MLDC to contain a stochastic background challenge.
The 3.5 dataset contained an isotropic stochastic background signal
along with instrumental noise. The stochastic background is characterised
by the dimensionless quantity,
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)=\frac{1}{\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}}\frac{\mathrm{d} \rho_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)}{\mathrm{d} \log{f}},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)$ is the energy density in gravitational waves
and $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}=3c^2H_0^2/8\pi G$ is the energy density required
to close the universe. 
The signal was created with a constant
gravitational wave spectrum, 
with amplitude within the range $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}} = 8.95\times 10^{-12} - 1.66\times 10^{-11}$
(where the Hubble constant was taken to be $H_0=70 \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Mpc}$).

The instrumental noise was created approximating LISA as a rigidly rotating
triangle with equal and constant arm lengths.
The amplitudes of the 
secondary noises were independently randomized  by $\pm 20\%$,
and include laser phase noise at a level of approximately ten times the secondary 
noise at 1mHz.

Two groups submitted entries for this challenge:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AEIBham} (a collaboration between the Albert Einstein Institute
(Germany) and the University of Birmingham (UK)) submitted multiple entries,
using different applications of the same Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analysis method. However, we will not compare all of the submissions, but
instead focus on the analysis of the $A$ and $E$ channels, for which two results were submitted
over two different frequency bands; 0.1--1 mHz (\textbf{AEIBham (a)})
and 0.1--5 mHz (\textbf{AEIBham (b)}).
\item \textbf{MTGWAG} (the Montana Gravitational Wave Astronomy Group (USA)) 
utilised a Parallel Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo search to
estimate the amplitude of the stochastic background, using all three of the 
$A$, $E$ and $T$ channels. They also parameterised
the noise and estimated the amplitudes of the individual position and 
acceleration noise spectra.
\end{itemize}

Two different datasets were created for Challenge 3.5; one using 
SyntheticLISA \cite{}, and one using LISACode \cite{}. Both of the groups 
analysed the SyntheticLISA data, in which the injected signal had
an amplitude
$\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}=1.123390\times 10^{-11}$. Table \ref{tab:SGWB_recovered}
shows the values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$ recovered by the different
analyses, along with a fractional error, 
$\Delta \Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}/\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$,
where $\Delta \Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$ is the difference between the recovered
and injected values; both groups recovered the injection
to within $10\%$. 
Figure \ref{fig:stochastic_pdf} shows the recovered posterior PDFs on 
$\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}$ for each of the analyses. 

The major difference between the analyses is the treatment of the instrumental
noise. 
The AEIBham analyses 
used analytical expressions to characterise the shape of the noise power spectra
in the $A$ and $E$ channels, such that the noise model had two unknown parameters ---
the overall amplitudes of the noise PSDs.
For this it was assumed that the secondary noises were symmetrical,
which was not true of these datasets. It was also assumed that the strain spectrum was
proportional to $f^3$ throughout the whole band, which was not in fact the case at higher frequencies. This
may explain why the AEIBham (b) result was further from the injected
value that either the AEIBham (a) result (where the GW spectrum was indeed
a true power law throughout the whole band) or the MTGWAG result (where the 
response function had been recalibrated using the training data to take 
this into account).

The MTGWAG analysis used all three channels, and compensated for the fact that the
GW spectrum was not a power law at high frequency by using a response function
calibrated using the training data. The noise was fully characterised 
in terms of the twelve secondary noise amplitudes (again assuming that the 
spectral shapes were fixed). The recovered secondary noise amplitudes 
were not constrained, but the total position or acceleration noise
in single arm of LISA can be well constrained. 
These noise combinations are compared to the injected
values in Table \ref{tab:MTGWAG_noise_est}.

\section{Moving forward: a synopsis of MLDC 4}
\label{sec:mldc4}

While the third round of the MLDCs was focused on increasing the complexity and variety of GW sources, we are devoting the next iteration to the \emph{global-fit} problem of detecting and analyzing sources of different types superposed in the LISA data. Thus, MDLC 4 consists of a single, ``whole enchilada'' challenge (MLDC 4) that includes all the sources of MLDCs 3.1--3.5 \emph{in the same dataset}, albeit with larger source numbers (for EMRIs and cosmic-string bursts) and parameter ranges (for MBH binaries and EMRIs). See Table \ref{table:MLDC4} for details. The duration of the dataset is again approximately two years ($2^{22} \times 15$ s), but the data are released both as a high-cadence time series of $2^{25}$ samples with $\Delta t = 1.875$ s, and as a downsampled time series of $2^{22}$ samples with $\Delta t = 15$ s (however, only the cosmic-string bursts and instrument noise contribute spectral content above 33 mHz).

Three versions of both datasets are released: fractional-frequency fluctuation data generated by Synthetic LISA \cite{synthlisa} and LISACode \cite{lisacode}, and equivalent strain data generated by the LISA Simulator \cite{lisasimulator}. In contrast to MLDCs 3.4 and 3.5, all the LISA instrument noises are set to symmetric, nominal levels, and the LISA armlength are allowed to ``breathe.'' See \cite{mldcgwdaw2,MLDC3} for more details about the MLDC models of LISA orbits, noises, and interferometric observables. The waveform models of MLDC 3 \cite{MLDC3} are used unchanged in MLDC 4, except for the following changes: when MBH binaries end within the duration of the dataset, they are terminated with a taper XXX; the spectra of cosmic-string bursts are truncated below $10^{-5}$ Hz; the stochastic-background spectrum is $f^{-3}$ between $10^{-5}$ Hz and 33 mHz, and drops lower below and above that range.

Challenges beyond MLDC 4 will feature ever more realistic datasets, including more sophisticated waveform models, such as MBH coalescences with merger and ringdown phases, and ``real-mission'' noise models and instrument events drawn from the ongoing experimental investigations of the LISA architecture and subsystem. To obtain more information and to participate in the MLDCs, see the official MLDC website, \url{astrogravs.nasa.gov/docs/mldc}, and the Task Force wiki, \url{www.tapir.caltech.edu/listwg1b}.
