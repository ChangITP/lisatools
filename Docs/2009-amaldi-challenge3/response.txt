We thank the referees for the useful comments.

We have added a reference [Baker J G et al. 2007 Phys. Rev. D 75 124024] for the possible z~20 detection of MBH binaries.

We have reworked Fig. 2 and Table 4, expanding the captions to clarify the issues flagged by the referee.

In addition, we have fixed typos, added references to relevant articles that have appeared in the meantime, and added an author (previously missed) to the byline.
