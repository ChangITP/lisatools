=== responses to editor ===

1. The author list is fine as is.
2. Reference 11 is still unpublished, but you may add "arXiv:" before the preprint number; reference 12 should be published in the same volume as this proceeding, or on JPCS (you should be able to find out...).
3. Colour on the web only is fine.
